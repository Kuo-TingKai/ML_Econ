Abstract 

In many countries information on expectations collected through consumer confidence surveys 

are used in macroeconomic policy formulation. Unfortunately, before doing so, the consistency 

of  responses  is  often  not  taken  into  account,  leading  to  biases  creeping  in  and  affecting  the 

reliability  of  the  indices  hence  created.  This  paper  describes  how  latent  class  analysis  may  be 

used  to  check  the  consistency  of  responses  and  ensure  a  parsimonious  questionnaire.  In 

particular,  we  examine  how  temporal  changes  may  be  incorporated  into  the  model.  Our 

methodology is illustrated using three rounds of Consumer Confidence Survey (CCS) conducted 

by Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

I. Introduction 

The effect  of  attitudes of non-financial  organizations and consumers on  economic activity is  a 

subject  of  great  interest  to  both  policymakers  and  economic  forecasters  (see  Galstyan  and 

Movsisyan, 2009). In particular, expectations about macroeconomic variables may influence the 

effectiveness  of monetary  and fiscal  policy  and also the direction of the economy  (see Phelps, 

1968).  This  underlines  the  importance  of  incorporating  such  expectations  in  the  process  of 

formulation  of  macroeconomic  policy.  Information  about  such  expectations  is  collected  by 

policy  makers  in  many  countries  through  consumer  confidence  surveys.  Examples  of  such 

surveys  are  Business  Tendency  and  Consumer  Surveys  of  the  Organization  for  Economic  Co-

operation  and  Development  in  Armenia,  The  Nielsen  Global  Survey  of  Consumer  Confidence 

and  Spending  Intentions  in  Hong  Kong,  Westpac-Melbourne  Institute  Survey  of  Consumer 

Sentiment, etc. Based on such surveys, consumer confidence indices are constructed and often 

used  in  policy  making  as  a  proxy  for  consumers’  expectations  about  the  future  trend  of  the 

economy. 

In India, information about the households’ perceptions about the current economic situation 

and  their  expectations  about  future  economic  changes  is  collected  on  a  quarterly  basis  by 

Reserve  Bank  of  India  since  June  2010 through  the  CCSs.  The  responses  to  these  surveys  are 

analyzed  to  obtain  pictures  of  households’  opinions  on  the  overall  economic  situation  (current 

and future) and their material security (current and future). In addition, the RBI calculates indices 

of  current  and  future  conditions  (see  RBI  Bulletin,  2012).  The  survey  data  are  a  potentially 

useful  tool  to  monitor  temporal  changes  in  households’  expectations.  Accordingly,  the  survey 

results are used by the RBI to formulate monetary policy and determine key monetary variables 

like Cash Reserve Ratio, interest rates, etc. 

3                                                                                    
 
 

Unfortunately, while constructing such indices, the reliability and consistency of responses is 

often  not  taken  into  account  (see  Katona,  1946,  1947).  This  leads  to  overlooking  of  biases  in 

consumer responses,  and may even affect  the reliability of the indices.  The RBI, too,  uses the 

survey  response  to  form  monetary  policy  variables  without  examining  the  consistency  of 

responses. This paper describes how latent  class analysis (LCA)—a latent variable model with 

discrete latent and indicator variables—may be used to check the consistency of responses and 

identify the variables that may be used to construct a reliable index of consumer sentiment about 

the economy. Our methodology is illustrated using the CCS conducted by RBI. 

The  paper  is  structured  as  follows.  Section  2  describes  the  framework  of  the  LCA  model. 

Sections 3 and 4 present the analysis of three rounds of CCS data using the software application 

poLCA.1 Finally, in section 5 and 6, we summarize our findings and identify potential areas for 

further research. 

 

II.   LCA models and response biases 

LCA Models 

LCA  is  a  statistical  method  for  clustering  the  related  cases  (identifying  latent  classes)  from 

multivariate categorical data, pioneered by Lazarsfeld (1950) and Lazarsfeld and Henry (1968). 

LCA  models  do  not  rely  on  traditional  modeling  assumptions  like  normal  distribution,  linear 

relationship, homogeneity etc. Both the latent and indicator variables of this model are discrete. 

LCA  is  a  subset  of  structural  equation  modelling,  used  to  classify  unobservable  sub-groups  or 

subtypes  of  cases  in  multivariate  categorical  data.  As  in  factor  analysis,  the  LCA  can  also  be 

used  to  group  cases  according  to  their  maximum  likelihood  class  membership.  LCA  may  be 

                                                           
1 The analysis is based on the most complete and most user-friendly package for the estimation of latent class 
models and latent class regression models in R (see Linger and Lewis, 2011; R Development Core Team, 2010)

applied to classify types of attitude structures from survey responses, consumer segments from 

demographic and preference variables, or categorize subpopulations based on their responses to 

test  items.  LCA  has  the  advantage  of  making  no  assumptions  about  the  distribution  of  the 

indicators other than that of local independence which says that the indicators share a common 

latent variable, but the errors in measurement are uncorrelated. Subsequent development allows 

this  assumption  to  be  relaxed.  Even  when  we  have  dependence  between  indicators,  it  can  be 

incorporated via interaction term among the indicator variables (e.g. Harper, 1972; Vacek, 1985; 

Hangenaars, 1988; Espeland and Handelman, 1989; Sinclair and Gastwirth, 1996; Reboussin et 

al., 2008; Bertrand and Haftner, 2011).  

 

Applications of LCA 

Clogg  and  Goodman  (1984)  were  the  first  to  introduce  a  latent  class  model  in  which  class 

(unobservable  categories  of  the  latent  variable)  membership  probabilities  and  item  response 

probabilities are conditioned on membership in an observed group. LCA with covariates extends 

the basic  LCA model to include predictors of class  membership.  In this  extension, latent  class 

membership probabilities are predicted by covariates through a logistic link (e.g. Bandeen et al 

1997; Dayton and Macready 1988). Latent class models have been applied in many domains. For 

example,  Sullivan  and  Kessler  (1998)  used  LCA  to  determine  empirically  the  typologies  of 

depressive  symptoms  in  the  national  co-morbidity  survey  (NCS)  in  U.S.  Yan  et  al.  (2012) 

applied latent class models to the data from two cycles of the National Survey of Family Growth 

(NSFG).  

5                                                                                    
 
 
Another application of LCA models is to test for the presence of different type of response biases 

in  consumer  surveys.  For  instance,  surveys  may  contain  biases  like  acquiescence,  extreme 

response style and social desirability: 

(i)  Acquiescence describes the general tendency of a person to provide confirmatory answers to 

items of questionnaires heedlessly of the content of the items (see Messick, 1967). 

(ii)  Extreme response bias refers to the tendency to uniformly endorse an optimistic view about 

the  economy  (positive  bias)  or  uniformly  report  a  negative  perception  about  the  economy 

(negative  bias),  irrespective  of  the  information  content  sought  (see  Baumgartner  and 

Steenkamp, 2006). 

(iii)  Social desirability is often referred as tendency to responding in a way that presents them 

favorably according to current cultural norms (see Mick, 1996). 

Identification  of  the  sources  of  such  errors  is  a  prerequisite  to  using  results  of  the  consumer 

confidence  surveys  in  formulating  macroeconomic  policies.  The  most  promising  way  of 

accounting  for  such  biases  is  through  application  of  statistical  techniques  to  analyze  survey 

responses.  Given  the  qualitative  nature  of  the  data  it  is  not  possible  to  use  the  classical  least 

squares  methodology.  So  the  more  flexible  alternative,  LCA,  has  been  used  in  such  exercises. 

For instance, Biemer and Winsen (2002) used LCA for estimating classification errors. This led 

to  identification  of  errors  in  the  design  of  questionnaire  and  wording  of  questions  (National 

Household Survey of Drug Abuse), necessitating adjusting estimates of prevalence of drug use 

for  classification  error  bias.  Bialowolski  (2012)  used  LCA  to  examine  the  sentiment  bias  and 

extreme response bias on the individual data from the State of Households’ inflation expectation 

survey conducted in Poland.

The present paper is part of an ongoing exercise to use LCA models to analyze the pattern of 

misclassification arising out of response biases in Reserve Bank of India’s Consumer Confidence 

Survey. Specifically, we propose to test for the presence of extreme response bias in the survey 

and identify the items affected by this bias. It extends an earlier analysis undertaken for a single 

time  period  to  show  how  the  impact  of  temporal  changes  may  be  incorporated  into  the  LCA 

model to evaluate reliability of CCS responses and identify sources of biases. Since the survey is 

conducted on a quarterly basis we have taken the data for the same quarter (first quarter in the 

financial  year,  ending  on  30th  June)  in  three  successive  years  —2010,  2011  and  2012.  These 

were  the  1st,  5th  and  9th  round  of  the  series  resp.  This  helps  to  factor  out  any  seasonal  effect 

between rounds. 

 

III. Database and methodology 

Database 

The  Consumer  Confidence  Survey  (CCS)  is  a  household  survey  designed  to  measure  an 

assessment  of  the  consumer  sentiments  of  the  respondents  based  on  their  perceptions  of  the 

general  conditions  and  their  own  financial  situation.  The  CCS  design  is  a  multistage  stratified 

sample covering six metropolitan cities, viz., Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai 

and  New  Delhi.  Each  city  is  stratified  into  three  major  areas  and  each  major  area  is  further 

stratified into three sub-areas. From each sub-area, about 100 respondents are selected randomly. 

For each round of survey, 5400 respondents are selected (900 respondents from each city).The 

assessments  are  made  in  two  parts,  viz.,  current  situation  as  compared  with  a  year  ago  and 

expectations for a year ahead. The survey schedule consists of qualitative questions pertaining to 

impression about economic conditions, views on household circumstances, perceptions on price 

7                                                                                    
 
 
level  and  employment  prospects  and  developments  in  real  estate  prices  and  views  on  growth 

potential  of  the  Indian  economy  (see  Table1).  In  addition,  information  was  elicited  on  age, 

gender, occupation and annual income of respondent. For this study, we have taken the data for 

the same quarter (first  quarter in  the financial  year, corresponding to  June) in  three successive 

years —2010, 2011 and 2012, in the analysis. Data from a total of 15523 schedules were used 

(about 4.2 percent of total responses were found to be unsuitable by RBI and not released).

Research methodology 

The  basic  structure  of  LCA  was  developed  by  Lazarsfeld  (1950),  Lazarsfeld  and  Henry 

(1968),  Goodman  (1974),  Clogg  (1995),  Clogg  and  Manning  (1996)  among  others.  A 

characteristic  feature  of  LCA  is  that  the  latent  variables  and  items  (directly  observed  manifest 

variables)  are  discrete.  The  relation  between  the  latent  variable  and  its  indicators  is  not 

deterministic,  but  probabilistic.  LCA  produces  the  classification  probabilities  of  the  individual 

respondents,  conditional  on  the  indicator  variables.  For  example  πa|x

A|Xπa|x

A|X is  the  conditional 

probability P(A=a|X=x) where X is the latent variable and A is one of the indicator variable.   

The  type  of  models  considered  in  our  analysis  is  limited  to  simple  extensions  of  the  basic 

latent class model as proposed in Biemer and Winsen (2002) with grouping variables defined by 

annual income (Z) and time (T). The use of grouping variables has been suggested by Hui and 

Walter (1980) to either ensure that the model is identifiable, or to improve the fit of the model or 

to  reduce  the  effect  of  unobserved  heterogeneity.  Although  our  model  is  identifiable,  the 

remaining two issues remain a matter of concern. Following the Hui-Walter approach, we choose 

income as the grouping variable. This is justified on two grounds.  

a)  An essential assumption of the LCA model is that the error probabilities are the same 

for each individual in  the population.  When this assumption is violated, as is likely 

 

 

                                            Assessing consistency of consumer confidence data                                          10 

 

for  groups  formed  on  the  basis  of  economic  variables  like  income,  we  say  that  the 

population is heterogeneous with respect to the error probabilities. Suppose however 

that  there  is  a  categorical  variable  (H)  such  that,  within  the  categories  of  H,  the 

assumption of homogeneity holds. When H is known then adding the term XHA to 

the model will achieve conditional homogeneity for XA, which is sufficient for model 

validity (Biemer, 2011).  

b)  Unlike other possible grouping variables like age, gender, occupation and household 

size, income is highly correlated with the latent variable (consumer confidence about 

the economy).  

The following is a description of the models that were used in the analysis 

(i)  Model 0: Assumes latent class membership affected by annual income (Z). 

(ii)  Model 1: Assumes latent class membership affected by occupation (O). 

(iii)  Model  2:  Assumes  latent  class  membership  affected  by  both  annual  income  (Z)  and 

occupation (O).  

(iv)  Model 3: Assumes latent class membership affected by annual income (Z) and economic 

condition (A and F i.e. retrospective and prospective). 

All  the  above  defined  models  postulate  that  the  consumer  confidence  varies  across  different 

combinations of (Z, T) values. Model 0 reflects a type of dependence of the error terms on the 

grouping variables but not the full dependence represented in other models. Models 1, 2 and 3 

represent the three possible cases of full dependence between the indicator variables, has been 

discussed in detail by Hagenaars (1988). Given the relatively large number of observed variables 

measuring the latent variable and the number of response categories per variable, the number of 

parameters is fairly high. For this reason larger models were not considered.  

11                                                                                    
 
 
After identifying the appropriate model from the above, we undertake the following analysis: 

(i)  Assess the optimal number of response classes for the latent variable; 

(ii) 

Identify indicators for which responses are inconsistent. We first ran the program for the 

three rounds separately, with all indicators A through J. We found that the performance 

of  indicator  variables  B  and  G  is  uniformly  poor  in  the  sense  of  yielding  a  high 

proportion of inconsistent responses in all the three rounds of data. Therefore, to reduce 

the  extreme  probabilities  of  indicator  variables  in  the  pooled  analysis  (with  all  three 

rounds of data together), we ran the program without the indicator variables B and G; 

(iii)  Verify  consistency  of  responses  for  remaining  part  of  the  RBI  questionnaire,  after 

dropping the inconsistent indicator variables; and, 

(iv)  Estimate  the  contribution  of  each  of  the  remaining  indicator  variables  to  the  latent  or 

outcome variable (viz. level of consumer confidence about the economy). 

This  will  ensure  a  questionnaire  that  is  parsimonious  in  terms  of  number  of  items  and  elicits 

responses which are consistent. 

 

IV.  Analysis  

Performance of Alternative models 

The  first  step  of  our  analysis  is  selection  of  the  ‘best’  model  from  the  list  of  four  models 

formulated.  Table  2  reports  necessary  statistics  for  comparing  between  the  four  alternative 

models. Selection is on the basis of Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) values as suggested by 

Lin and Dayton (1997). From Table 2 we can see that Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and 

BIC are minimized in Model 3. Further, the Log Likelihood (LL) value is also satisfactory for 

this model. Therefore Model 3 is used in our subsequent analysis.

Considering alternative number of classes 

A  latent  class  is  a  variable  indicating  underlying  subgroups  of  individuals  based  on  observed 

characteristics. Membership in the subgroup is said to be “latent” because membership in a class 

cannot be directly observed. In the context of CCS data for instance, classes indicate the number 

of  categories  into  which  the  responses  about  perception  about  current  scenario  of  the  Indian 

economy and future anticipated trend of the economy may be divided. In this study we consider 

three alternatives: 

(i)  Two-class (where consumers rate current scenario/future prospects of the economy as 

either positive or negative) 

(ii)  Three-class (where consumers rate current scenario/future prospects of the economy 

as either positive, indifferent or negative) 

(iii) 

Four-class  (which  incorporates  strength  of  confidence  about  current  situation/future 

scenario of the economy).

We  next  try  to  identify  which  class  is  appropriate  under  Model  3  by  undertaking  LCA  on  the 

three alternate versions of Model 3. The full results of the LCA for 2- and 4-classes of model 3 

are omitted, presenting only the goodness of fit statistics for 2-, 3- and 4-classes of the model 3 

in Table 3. Both the AIC and BIC criteria indicate that the three class model is the most suitable 

for analysis in terms of goodness of fit and parsimony.

Interpretation of three-class Model 3 

Table 4 illustrates the estimated class conditional response probabilities for the indicators A, C, 

D, E, F, H,  I and J, with each row corresponding to  a latent  class of consumer sentiment, and 

each column corresponding to classes of the indicator variable values. Thus, the first row (class 

1) reports the analysis results for respondents who are in general optimistic about the economy, 

the  second  row  (class  2)  reports  results  for  respondents  who  feel  that  the  economic  prospects 

have  remained  unchanged,  while  the  third  row  states  results  for  respondents  with  negative 

perceptions in general about the economy  — as classified by the indicator  variable.  For each 

row, 

the 

columns 

give 

conditional  probabilities 

that 

the 

respondent 

has 

a 

positive/indifferent/negative feeling  (respectively) in  terms  of the latent  variable.  For  example, 

second  row,  first  column  of  each  block  is  the  conditional  probability  P(A=  indifferent|X= 

improve). In particular, the diagonal cells (a=x) give the probability of consistent responses. For 

indicator A, then values are P(A  = positive|  X = improve) = 1;  P(A = indifferent|  X = remain 

same) = 0.3635 and P(A = negative| X = deteriorate) = 0.6764. Similarly we interpret the results 

for other indicators.

Figure 1.Extreme false negative and extreme false positive probabilities for different indicators 

Information  about  extreme  false  positive  and  negative  probabilities  from  Table  4  is 

summarized in Figure 1. Figure 1 illustrates that the extreme false  positive probabilities are all 

below 0.45 and extreme false negative probabilities are close to zero.  

  We  also  calculate  the  probabilities  of  consistent  classification  for  all  indicators  separately 

with the estimated class population shares. This probability is calculated as follows:

sentiment  is  being  captured  consistently  through  the  indicators.  The  probabilities  are  given  in

The  height  of  the  grey  bar  gives  the  probability  of  consistent  classification  of  each  indicator 

while  the  height  of  the  black  bar  gives  the  probability  of  inconsistent  classification  for  that 

indicator.  We  can  see  that  the  probability  of  consistent  classification  of  all  indicators  is  much 

higher than the probability of misclassification. From results stated in Table A1 in Appendix II, 

we  find  that  all  the  indicators  are  performing  well  in  terms  of  classification.  The  correct 

classification percentage for A, C, D and F are all close to 70% while that for the other are in the 

range 50 to 60 %. The misclassification percentage is uniformly low (not more than 11% as for 

E).  On  average,  the  probability  of  consistent  misclassification  is  0.062  and  consistent 

classification  is  0.629.  Therefore,  the  probability  of  inconsistent  responses  for  individual 

indicators is within acceptable limits. 

 

V.  Contribution of different indicators towards classification 

Our  analysis  in  section  4  shows  that  the  responses  are  consistent,  with  probabilities  of 

inconsistent  responses  to  individual  indicators  lying  within  acceptable  limits.  Given  this 

consistency,  the  next  step  is  to  estimate  the  contribution  of  each  indicator  to  the  overall 

classification indicator, and examine the statistical significance of the contributions. 

Table 5 reports the significance of all the indicators included in the interaction terms of the 

model (A & F) both in terms of their direct  effect as well as the interaction effect.  Both these 

indicators  as  well  as  the  grouping  variable  Z  (income)  are  significant  contributors  to  the 

classification exercise.  The interaction of the indicators with  grouping  variable and time (two-

way and three-way) are significant. The only exception is the interaction terms of Z and time for 

class 2 versus class 1.

The  effect  of  time  is  uniformly  significant  individually  as  well  as  in  the  interactions, 

indicating  that  perceptions  are  changing  over  time  but  doing  so  in  a  predictable  manner.  This 

justifies the incorporation of the time dimension in all models, which also enhance the predictive 

power.

VI.   Conclusion 

In many countries expectations collected through consumer confidence surveys are used in the 

process of macroeconomic policy formulation. Unfortunately, before doing so, the reliability of 

responses  is  often  not  taken  into  account,  leading  to  biases  creeping  in  and  affecting  the 

reliability of the indices. In particular extreme response bias is an important category of bias that 

may  distort  the  results  of  the  survey.  Using  three  rounds  of  Consumer  Confidence  Survey 

conducted by Reserve Bank of India this paper describes how latent class analysis may be used 

to check the reliability of responses and evaluate the performance (in terms of consistency and 

contribution to the overall outcome indicator, viz. consumer confidence about the economy) of 

eight indicators used in the survey.  

The goodness of fit results (using likelihood ratio, AIC and BIC criteria) all indicate that 

the optimal model classifies the responses into three classes, reflecting the attitude of responses 

about  the  economy  (positive,  indifference  and  negative).  This  is  consistent  with  current  RBI 

practice.  Indicators  B  and  G  had  to  be  dropped  from  our  analysis  because  of  severe 

inconsistencies in responses in all three rounds. We suggest that these questions should either be 

reformulated (and the consistency of responses rechecked), or they should be dropped from the 

23                                                                                    
 
 
questionnaire altogether. The results show that all the factors used in the analysis are significant 

at  the  individual  level  and  also  interacting  with  time  and  income  groups.  The  classification 

performance is uniformly good for these indicators. Thus, there is no need to further reduce the 

questions in the CCS. 

The optimal configuration of interactions among the indicators and the grouping factors 

like time and income is also identified. The attitude of consumers reveals a predictable change 

over time as well as over income groups. Thus differential effects of alternative policies may be 

judged from  our models. Hence, our results may help  in  shifting from broad based policies to 

policies  with  greater  potential  for  targeting  specific  groups  across  socio  economic  lines. 

Secondly,  such  policies  may  also  incorporate  the  impact  of  temporal  changes  in  attitude  or 

preferences, making such policies more dynamic. Thus, it would be interesting to study such a 

scenario with the help of a panel data where we would be able to identify the impact of time on 

changes in consumer preferences and outlook.
