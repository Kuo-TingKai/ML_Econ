ARCH and GARCH Models  

 Martingale Volatility of Finance Market Returns 

 
ARCH  and  GARCH  models  assume  either  i.i.d.  or  ‘white 
noise’  as  is  usual  in  regression  analysis  while  assuming 
memory  in  a  conditional  mean  square  fluctuation  with 
stationary increments. We will show that ARCH/GARCH is 
inconsistent with uncorrelated increments, violating the i.i.d. 
and ‘white’ assumptions and finance data and the efficient 
market hypothesis as well.  
 
Key  Words:  nonstationary  differences/increments,  ARCH, 
GARCH, martingales, efficient market hypothesis, volatility

1. Introduction 
 
In economics a point x at time t in a stochastic process x(t) is 
called a ‘level’ and an increment x(t,-T)=x(t)-x(t-T) is called a 
‘first difference’. Variables x that are logarithmic in a price 
variable are usual both in finance [1,2] and macroeconomics 
[3]. 
 
Given  a  stochastic  process  x(t),  where 
finance 
x(t)=ln(p(t)/pc) [1,2] with pc is a reference price at time t [4],  
a  stationary  increment/difference  [5,6,7,8]  is  one  where                                                  
x(t,-T)= ln(p(t)/p(t-T))=x(0,-T) in distribution, the difference 
is independent  of the starting time t  and  depends  only  on 
the time lag T. To make this precise, with z=x(t,T)=y-x then 
the increment density is given by 
 
 
 
where  f2  is  the  2-point  density  of  returns,  and  increment 
stationarity  means 
f(z,t,t+T)=f(z,0,T)= 
, nothing more and nothing less [2]. The 1-
point density of returns or ‘levels’, in contrast, is  given by 
.  If  the  condition  (1)  fails  to  hold, 
then the increments are nonstationary. Ito processes where 
(1) holds are nontrivial to construct, aside from the Wiener 
process [9]. 
 
in  particular  and 
In  discussions  of  ARCH,  GARCH 
regression  analysis  in  general,  an  inadequate  distinction  is 
made  between  noise  levels  and  noise  increments.  We’ve 
noted that the noise in regression eqns. must be interpreted 
as  noise  increments  whether  one  assumes  i.i.d.  or  ‘white 
noise’. Therefore, what Engle [10] calls a ‘variance’, should 

exactly 

that 

  ! f(z,t,t+T)=dxdyf2""(y,t+T;x,t)#(z$y+x)  ! dxf2"(x+z,T;x,0)  ! f1(x,t)=dyf2"(y,t+T;x,t) 

 

 

be  called  a  mean  square  fluctuation1.  This  will  be  made 
precise  in  the  next  section,  where  we  will  point  out  that 
“white  noise”  in  econometrics  means  stationary  noise 
increments with vanishing increment autocorrelations [9]. 
 
There  are  various  volatility  measures  in  practical  use  in 
finance  theory  [2].  The  volatility  measure  chosen  by  Engle 
[10]  is  (in  our  language)  the  conditional  mean  square 
fluctuation 
.    In  a  diffusive  model  (an 
Ito process) this would be given by 
 
 
 
where  p2  is  the  conditional  density  for  the  returns  process 
x(t).   
 
In  all  that  follows,  we  assume  detrended  data  [1]  and/or 
detrended  stochastic  models  of  levels  x(t).  With  the  choice 
x(0)=0 the process variance is given by 
where  the  process  x(t)  is  then  drift  free  noise.    Only 
uncorrelated  noise  increments  are  of  interest  here.  That  is, 
we  assume 
that

where t is the time, T is a time lag, and typically it’s assumed 
that the conditional expectation is linear and time-lagged in 
y, 
 
 
 
The economists usually take T=1 period (as in one quarter of 
a year) but we avoid that restriction because it masks the fact 
that stationary increments cannot be treated as a stationary 
process if T is allowed to vary.  The noise increment x(t,-T) is 
assumed to be “white”, meaning in econometrics that (i) the 
increments are stationary, 
 ‘in distribution’, 
,  (iii)  the 
increments  are  uncorrelated

 (there is no reason to assume i.i.d. noise, 
job  [9]). 
the  mean  square 
constant: 
is 
=constant  for  T=1,  e.g.  The  reason 
that we denote the noise by “x” rather than “ε” will become 
clear when we introduce martingales in part 3.  
 
ARCH models were proposed in 1982 [10] because of certain 
historical  facts.  The  Black-Scholes  model    [11]  was  in  its 
heyday,  but  the  Black-Scholes  model  is  nonvolatile:  the 
detrended  Gaussian 
the  simplest 
for 
martingale, 
2  is  constant.  There  is  no 
V(t,-T)=
volatility here because the dependence on the last observed 
point x at time t-T has disappeared. Volatility (2) requires an 
x-dependence,  otherwise  the  conditional  average  V  cannot 
fluctuate at all as t is increased.  
 
The standard statement of an ARCH(1) process [12,13] is that

.  Clearly,  as  has  been  pointed  out 
recently [9], both the noise and the variable y here are not 
levels, they are both increments. Having made this clear, we 
now return to our standard notation for increments. We’ve 
pointed  out  elsewhere  [1,2]  that  it’s  quite  common,  if 
mistaken, to regard the log increment x(t)=ln(p(t)/p(t-T)) as 
a process, or level. In Ito calculus the levels obey stochastic 
differential  eqns.  and  Fokker-Planck  eqns.,  but 
the 
differences (except in the trivial case of a Wiener process) do 
not [2]. 
 
Historically, ARCH models were introduced to remedy the 
lack of volatility of  the Gaussian returns model. The ARCH 
models  were  constructed  with  memory  intentionally  built 
into the mean square fluctuation [12]. Whether or not it was 
realized  that  the  efficient  market  hypothesis  (EMH)  is 
violated 
is  not  clear  because  previous  discussions  of 
martingales  as  the  EMH  focused  on  simple  averages  and 
ignored pair correlations [14,15] (this is not entirely true, but 
Fama  [15]  stated  the  serial  correlations  of  a  martingale 
incorrectly  [8]).  We  will  show  in  part  3  below  that  the 
contradiction  between  ARCH  and  the  EMH  was  probably 
masked  by  failing  to  distinguish  between 
levels  and 
differences in the noise. 
 
The ARCH(1) model [10,12,13] is defined by the regression 
eqn.

with the assumption that the increments are stationary, are 
independent of t. In addition, the assumption was made that 
 
 
 
where z(T) was originally taken to be i.i.d. with zero mean 
and  unit  variance.  It’s  adequate  to  assume  that  z(T)  is 
uncorrelated [9] with zero mean and unit variance. The idea 
is that x(t,-T)=x(0,-T) ‘in distribution’ is the stationary noise 
in  regression  eqns.  (3)  if  T  is  held  fixed.  So  far,  this  is 
completely  in  the  spirit  of  regression  analysis:  the  noise  is 
not  assumed  to  have  been  discovered  empirically,  it’s 
postulated in as simple a way as possible.  
 
The unconditioned averages in ARCH(1) then obey 
 
 
 
 
In  regression  analysis  the  assumption  typically  is  that  the 
increments  are  stationary.  Stationary  increments  may  have 
been inferred (rather, hypothesized) by ‘eyeballing plots’ of 
levels and differences [10,16,17], but were never verified, so 
far  as  we  understand  it  [16],  by  an  analysis  based  on 
constructing  ensemble  averages  (ensemble  averages  are 
constructed  from  a  single,  long  time  series  in  ref.  [1,2]). 
Accepting the assumption of stationary increments for now, 
we obtain

This  is  a  relationship  that  can  be  checked,  but  that  fact  is 
masked by setting T=1 in regression analysis. We now show 
completely  generally,  without  appeal  to  any  particular 
dynamics,  that  ARCH(1)  is  completely  inconsistent  with 
‘white noise’ (uncorrelated noise differences)  
 
Increment autocorrelations are given by

With stationary increments we obtain 
 
 
 
The increment autocorrelations vanish iff. the levels variance 
is  linear  in  the  time  [8],  which  then  yields  also  that 
.  Inserting  this  into  (11),  if  we  set  T=0 
then we obtain  α=0. If T≠0 then we obtain  ω=0. This shows 
that  ARCH(1)  is  inconsistent  with  stationary,  uncorrelated 
increments. The same conclusion will hold if the increments 
are  nonstationary  and  uncorrelated.  The  reason  for  the 
contradiction  is  clear:  uncorrelated  increments  guarantee  a 
martingale  x(t),  and  the  martingale  condition  rules  out 
memory at the level of simple averages and pair correlations 
[8]. ARCH models have finite memory built in at that level. 
The correct way to understand the ARCH models is that the 
memory  is  requires  nonvanishing  increment  correlations. 
This violates the EMH and finance data as well [1,2]. Higher 
order ARCH models admit exactly the same interpretation.

If we again assume stationary increments then we obtain an 
analogous constant mean square fluctuation for fixed T. In 
this  case  ‘white  noise’  would  imply  that  α=0  and  that 
.  With  enough  parameters  the  models  are  not 
falsifiable.  There  is  no  evidence  for  memory  in  observed 
finance  market  returns  for  T≥10  min.  [1,2].    ARCH  and 
GARCH  models  are  only  applicable  to  processes  with 
correlated increments, and not to ‘white noise’ processes. In 
financial applications this requires lag time of T<10 min. in 
trading. Correlated increments occur for fractional Brownian 
motion, but not for efficient finance markets [1,2,8].
