Asymptotic expansion for characteristic function in Heston

stochastic volatility model with fast mean-reverting correction

Ankush Agarwal∗

August 20, 2018

Abstract

In this note, we derive the characteristic function expansion for logarithm of the under-

lying asset price Xτ in corrected Heston model as proposed by Fouque and Lorig [1].

Introduction

Heston model [3] has been the most widely used stochastic volatility model as it provides an
explicit formula for calculating European option prices. But as noted by Fouque and Lorig [1] ,
the model fails to capture the implied volatility skew in far in-the-money and out-of-the-money
European options. A suggested explanation for this shortcoming is the single factor of volatility
in the model which is not suﬃcient for describing the dynamics of the observed volatility process.
In [1], the authors proposed a fast mean-reverting correction to the Heston model which
still preserves the explicitness of the formula for European option price. It is demonstrated that
the corrected Heston model captures the market implied volatility skew better than the original
Heston model.

In this note, we use similar singular perturbative expansion to derive a correction to the

characteristic function of the logarithm of underlying asset price in the Heston model.

2 Multi-Scale Model and Characteristic function PDE

Under the pricing risk-neutral probability measure P, consider the price St of an asset whose
dynamics is described by the following system of stochastic diﬀerential equations:

dSt = rStdt + ΣtStdW x
t ,
Σt = pZtf (Yt),

Zt
ǫ

dYt =

(m − Yt)dt + ν√2r Zt
dYt = κ(θ − Zt)dt + σpZtdW z

ǫ

dW y

Here, W x

t , W y

t and W z

t are one-dimensional Brownian motions with the correlation structure

dhW x, W yit = ρxydt,
dhW x, W zit = ρxzdt,
dhW y, W zit = ρyzdt,

where the correlation coeﬃcients ρxy, ρxz and ρxy are constants satisfying ρ2
xz < 1,
yz < 1, and ρ2
ρ2
yz − 2ρxyρxzρyz < 1 in order to ensure positive deﬁniteness of
the covariance matrix of the three Brownian motions. Next, we set Xt = log St and get the
corresponding stochastic diﬀerential equation which describes the dynamics of Xt:

Let us deﬁne the characteristic function of logarithm of the underlying asset price at expiry as

ψǫ(t, x, y, z) := E(cid:2)eisXT |Xt = x, Yt = y, Zt = z(cid:3)

where we have used the Markov property of (Xt, Yt, Zt) and deﬁned the characteristic function
ψǫ(t, x, y, z), the superscript ǫ denoting the dependence on the small parameter ǫ. Using the
Feynman-Kac formula for ψǫ(t, x, y, z), a conditional expectation, we get the following PDE and
boundary conditions:

Lǫψǫ(t, x, y, z) = 0,

ψǫ(T, x, y, z) = eisx

Lǫ =

+ L(X,Y,Z),

where the operator L(X,Y,Z) is the inﬁnitesimal generator of the process (Xt, Yt, Zt):

3 Asymptotic analysis

.

(4)

In order to achieve an approximation for the characteristic function ψǫ, we perform a singular
perturbation with respect to the small parameter ǫ, expanding the solution in powers of √ǫ

ψǫ(t, x, y, z) = ψ0(t, x, y, z) + √ǫψ1(t, x, y, z) + ǫψ2(t, x, y, z) + . . . .

(5)

We plug (5) and (4) into (1) and (3), and collect terms of equal powers of √ǫ.

2

Order 1/ǫ terms. Collecting terms of order 1/ǫ we have the following PDE:

As L0 takes derivatives with respect to only y, the ﬁrst equation implies that ψ0 is independent
of y.
In fact, L0 is an inﬁnitesimal generator and consequently zero is an eigenvalue with
constant eigenfunctions. Thus, we seek ψ0 of the form

zL0ψ0 = 0.

ψ0 = ψ0(t, x, z).

Order 1/√ǫ terms. Collecting terms of order 1/√ǫ leads to the following PDE:

0 = zL0ψ1 + zL1ψ0,
= zL0ψ1.

where we have used the result that ψ0 is independent of y. For the same reasons as ψ0, ψ1 is
also independent of y. Thus, we seek ψ1 of the form

ψ1 = ψ1(t, x, z).

Order 1 terms. Matching terms of order 1 leads to the following PDE and boundary

condition:

0 = zL0ψ2 + zL1ψ1 + L2ψ0,
= zL0ψ2 + L2ψ0,

eisx = ψ0(T, x, z),

(6)

(7)

where we have used the independence of ψ1 on y.

We note that (6) is a Poisson equation for ψ2 with respect to the inﬁnitesimal generator L0.
A solution for ψ2 exists if and only if L2ψ0 is centered with respect to the invariant distribution
of the diﬀusion whose inﬁnitesimal generator is L0. Thus, the centering condition becomes

hL2ψ0i = 0,

where the angled brackets indicate taking the average of the argument with respect to the
invariant distribution of the diﬀusion whose inﬁnitesimal generator is L0. Since ψ0 does not
depend on y, the centering condition becomes

hL2iψ0 = 0.

(8)

We note that the PDE (8) along with the boundary condition (7) jointly deﬁne a Cauchy
problem that ψ0(t, x, z) must satisfy. As we show later, this is equivalent to solving the PDE
for characteristic function in Heston model.

Using (6) and the centering condition we can show

ψ2 = −

2L−1

0 (cid:16)L2 − hL2i(cid:17)ψ0.

(9)

Order √ǫ terms. Collecting terms of order √ǫ, we obtain the following PDE and boundary

condition:

0 = zL0ψ3 + zL1ψ2 + L2ψ1,
0 = ψ1(T, x, z).

(10)

(11)

We note that ψ3 solves the Poisson equation in y with respect to L0. Thus, we impose the

corresponding centering condition on the source zL1ψ2 + L2ψ1, leading to

Plugging ψ, given by (9) into the above equation, we get

hL2iψ1 = −zhL1ψ2i.

hL2iψ1 = Aψ0,
A := (cid:28)zL1

(12)

Note that the PDE (12) and the boundary condition (11) deﬁne a Cauchy problem that
ψ1(t, x, z) must satisfy.

4 Calculation of leading order terms

Calculation of ψ0. Our previous analysis shows that ψ0 is the solution of the following Cauchy
problem

hL2iψ0 = 0,

ψ0(T, x, z) = eisx.

(14)

Like in [1], without loss of generality, we normalize f so that hf 2i = 1. Thus, we can write,

where ρ := ρxzhfi. It is clear that hL2i in (15) is a Heston model operator modulated with
eﬀective correlation term ρxz ¯f with ¯f := hfi. Thus, we choose the solution ψ0 of the following
form

Plugging back the solution form into the PDE (13), we get the following equations:

ψ0 = exp(C(T − t) + zD(T − t) + isx).

V4 = ρxyρxzσν√2hf ξ ′i.

We go back to Equation (12) and (10) to get the PDE with boundary condition:

hL2iψ1 = Aψ0,

ψ1(T, x, z) = 0.

Ansatz:

ψ1 = (κθf0(t, s) + zf1(t, s))ψ0.

We substitute our choice of ansatz into the PDE and boundary condition. After comparing
the same order of z terms, we can show that f0(t, s) and f1(t, s) satisfy the following system of
ODEs:

∂f0
∂t

= −f1,

f1(T, s) = 0,

∂f1

= a(t, s)f1(t, s) + b(t, s),

f0(T, s) = 0,
a(t, s) = −σ2D(t, s) + (κ − ρσis),
b(t, s) = −(cid:0)V1D(s2 + is) − V2isD2 + V3(is3 − s2) + V4s2D(cid:1).

5 Future work

As shown here, a correction to the characteristic function of Xt, logarithm of the underlying
asset price, in the Heston model can be easily obtained in the new model of Fouque and Lorig.
[2] have proposed asymptotics of the implied volatility in the Heston model which
Friz et al.
use saddle point approximation for the characteristic function of Xt. The next step is to use
the corrected characteristic function formula to derive improved implied volatility asymptotics
in the corrected Heston model which capture the observed market skew more eﬃciently.
