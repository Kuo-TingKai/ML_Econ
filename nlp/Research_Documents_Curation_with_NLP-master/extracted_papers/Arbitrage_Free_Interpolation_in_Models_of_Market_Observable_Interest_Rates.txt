ARBITRAGE–FREE INTERPOLATION IN MODELS OF MARKET OBSERVABLE

INTEREST RATES

ERIK SCHL ¨OGL

ABSTRACT. Models which postulate lognormal dynamics for interest rates which are compounded
according to market conventions, such as forward LIBOR or forward swap rates, can be con-
structed initially in a discrete tenor framework. Interpolating interest rates between maturities in
the discrete tenor structure is equivalent to extending the model to continuous tenor. The present
paper sets forth an alternative way of performing this extension; one which preserves the Mar-
kovian properties of the discrete tenor models and guarantees the positivity of all interpolated
rates.

Practitioners have long priced caps, ﬂoors and other interest rate derivative contracts by Black/
Scholes–like1 formulae, a practice usually attributed to the work of Black (1976). Initially, this
approach was very much focused on the pricing of individual contracts, without regard to the
arbitrage relationships between different ﬁxed income instruments. The seminal paper of Ho
and Lee (1986) instigated further research into models of the entire yield curve and ﬁtting initial
data, where the yield curve was given either terms of zero coupon bond prices2 or continuously
compounded short or forward rates. The latter approach was taken by Heath, Jarrow and Morton
(1992) (HJM), who developed a general framework for models of the term structure of interest
rates, deriving drift conditions for instantaneous forward rates which must be satisﬁed in any
arbitrage–free model. Thus the fundamental objects of these models were mainly mathemati-
cal constructs, not market observables. The ﬁrst work to move away from this paradigm was
Sandmann and Sondermann (1989, 1994), who construct a binomial term structure model with
the short rate compounded according to market conventions (e.g. three–month LIBOR) as the
fundamental model variable. Taking the modelling of market observable interest rates to contin-
uous time and bringing theoretical developments back into line with widespread market practice,
Miltersen, Sandmann and Sondermann (1997)3 (MSS) embedded the pricing of caps and ﬂoors
by Black/Scholes–like formulae in a consistent HJM framework. The critical assumption for this
result is that relative volatility4 of observable market forward rates such as LIBOR is determin-
istic.5

Brace, Gatarek and Musiela (1997) (BGM) resolved key questions in the construction of such
a model, in particular concerning existence and measure relationships. Given the deterministic
volatility assumption, they explicitly identiﬁed forward LIBOR as lognormal martingales under
the forward measure to the end of the respective accrual periods. Their label Market Models

seems to have become the generally accepted descriptor for models which postulate lognormal-
ity (under the appropriate probability measure) for market observable interest rates. The same
methodology can be applied to forward swap rates to derive a model which supports the market
practice of pricing swaptions by a Black/Scholes–type formula, as demonstrated by Jamshidian
(1997). Miltersen, Nielsen and Sandmann (2001) use a similar approach to construct a model of
lognormal futures rates (implied by the prices of interest rate futures), which nests the lognormal
forward LIBOR model.

Starting point of our discussion is the work of Musiela and Rutkowski (1997), who bring
important clarity into the construction of lognormal market models. Besides explicitly deriving
the relationships between forward measures of different maturities, they set up the model of
lognormal forward LIBORs for a discrete set of maturities (the tenor structure) ﬁrst and then
extend it to a continuum of maturities by applying the assumptions of BGM, i.e. lognormality
of all forward rates with compounding period δ and zero volatility for all zero coupon bonds
with time to maturity less than δ. This makes transparent the fact that extending the model to
continuous tenor in effect stipulates how the model will interpolate between a discrete set of
maturities. Note that in all cases considered in the present paper the stochastic dynamics of
interest rates are modelled in continuous time. Interpolation occurs in the maturity dimension
only. Furthermore, the rates modelled have a ﬁxed maturity (as opposed to a ﬁxed time–to–
maturity).
In simple terms, the question addressed is how to determine the continuous time
dynamics of, say, the yield for an investment maturing next August given the continuous time
dynamics of three–month forward rates for accrual periods starting in March, June, September
and December of every year.

Specifying lognormal dynamics for all δ–compounded forward rates, as MSS and BGM do,
has the obvious advantage that all caplets and ﬂoorlets on such rates are valued by Black/Scholes–
like formulae. However, this elegance comes at a price. For one, the no–arbitrage with cash
property cannot be guaranteed, i.e. although the forward LIBORs modelled as lognormal will
always be positive, other rates may not be.6 Second, the Markovian properties of the discrete
tenor model are lost; this is a fact which can cause considerable problems in numerical imple-
mentations, including Monte Carlo simulation, as we will discuss below. Third, one may take
the pragmatic point of view that in reality one observes only a discrete number of rates on the
market, with the rest determined by some interpolation method of choice. Thus one may prefer
a version of the model which implies an interpolation method for future dates that is transparent
and tractable. As the approach of Musiela and Rutkowski (1997) to the construction of a con-
tinuous tenor model makes clear, once volatilities are speciﬁed for continuous tenor, one has the
freedom to arbitrarily interpolate initial observed market rates. Thereafter, interpolation is ﬁxed
by no arbitrage conditions and must be evaluated numerically.

The alternative way of extending a lognormal market model from discrete to continuous tenor
proposed here addresses each of these points. It is also worthy to note that while the practical
relevance of the lognormal market models makes the deterministic volatility case a natural focus
of attention, Musiela and Rutkowski’s forward measure approach to term structure modelling
is valid for much more general volatility speciﬁcations, and this generality carries over to a
large part of the results presented here. In particular, this is true for other models constructed in
discrete tenor, such as the lognormal forward swap rate model of Jamshidian (1997).

In the present paper, the extension to continuous tenor is initially performed by deterministi-
cally interpolating zero coupon bond prices maturing before the earliest (future) date in the tenor
structure (the “short bonds”), not only for the initial term structure, but at any future time as

6Musiela and Rutkowski (1997) give an example of this.

well (section 1). At any point in time, interpolation of longer–dated bonds is determined by no
arbitrage conditions (section 2). Interpolating short bond prices from the two adjacent discrete
tenor LIBORs introduces volatility for the short bonds and the associated interest rates (section
3). The dynamics of all interpolated rates remain Markovian in the state vector of discrete tenor
forward LIBORs (section 4). The properties of the interpolated rates are discussed in section 5.
Section 6 analyses the implications for the pricing of cap/ﬂoor contacts which do not ﬁt into the
discrete tenor structure and section 7 concludes.

1. INTERPOLATION OF SHORT–DATED BONDS

Given a ﬁltered probability space (Ω,{Ft}t∈[0,T ∗], IPT ∗) satisfying the usual conditions, let
{WT ∗(t)}t∈[0,T ∗] denote a d–dimensional standard Wiener process and assume that the ﬁltration
{Ft}t∈[0,T ∗] is the usual IPT ∗–augmentation of the ﬁltration generated by {WT ∗(t)}t∈[0,T ∗].

The model is set up on the basis of assumptions (BP.1) and (BP.2) of Musiela and Rutkowski
(1997):
(BP.1) For any date T ∈ [0, T ∗], the price process of a zero coupon bond B(t, T ), t ∈ [0, T ] is a
strictly positive special martingale under IPT ∗.
(BP.2) For any ﬁxed T ∈ [0, T ∗], the forward process

FB(t, T, T ∗) =

B(t, T )
B(t, T ∗)

,

∀ t ∈ [0, T ]

follows a martingale under IPT ∗.

Note that assumption (BP.2) means that IPT ∗ can be interpreted as the time T ∗ forward measure
and implies that the bond price dynamics are arbitrage–free.

The objects to be modelled on the ﬁxed income markets are the δ-compounded forward rates

deﬁned by

(1)

L(t, T ) = δ−1

(cid:18) B(t, T )

B(t, T + δ)

(cid:19)

− 1

Since the compounding matches the market convention for rates such as the London Interbank
Offer Rate, L(t, T ) is also referred to as forward LIBOR.
Consider a discrete tenor structure T = {T0, . . . , TN}. For notational simplicity, let T0 = 0
also be the time origin and Ti+1 − Ti = δ ∀ i < N. The dynamics of the rates L(·, Ti), 1 ≤ i <
N, are given as in the discrete tenor version of the lognormal forward rate model put forth by
Musiela and Rutkowski (1997):7
(2)
where WTi+1 is a d-dimensional standard Brownian motion under the time Ti+1 forward measure
IPTi+1 and λ : IR × T → IRd is a deterministic function of its arguments, i.e. each L(t, Ti) is a
lognormal martingale under IPTi+1.8

dL(t, Ti) = L(t, Ti)λ(t, Ti)dWTi+1(t)

Deﬁne the function

η(t) : [T0, TN [→ {0, . . . , N}

7Note that the focus here is on lognormal forward LIBOR models for expositional purposes only, because this
represents the mainstream of the literature. The results presented here apply equally well to the discrete tenor
versions of other models of market observable rates, such as the lognormal forward swap rate model of Jamshidian
(1997) or extensions such models to more general volatility functions, such as the model of level–dependent LIBOR
volatilities proposed by Andersen and Andreasen (1998).

Similarly to the extensions to continuous tenor proposed in Brace, Gatarek and Musiela (1997)
and Musiela and Rutkowski (1997), we initially make the following

1.1. ASSUMPTION. Let volatility be zero for all zero coupon bonds B(t1, t2) maturing by the
next (future) date in the tenor structure T, i.e. t1 ≤ t2 ≤ Tη(t1).
Consequently, at time Ti the price of the zero coupon bond maturing in Ti+1 is given by

B(Ti, Ti+1) = (1 + δL(Ti, Ti))−1

and its dynamics are deterministic thereafter. Since they are deterministic, interpolation of in-
terest rates with time to maturity less than δ is the same as specifying the evolution of the bond
price, and arbitrary deterministic dynamics can be speciﬁed for B(t, Ti+1), Ti < t < Ti+1, with
B(Ti+1, Ti+1) = 1. For obvious reasons, these dynamics should be monotonically increasing
and continuous, which means deﬁning the continuously compounded short rate as some positive
function9 r(s, L(Tη(s)−1, Tη(s)−1)), such that10

Thus r(t) is an Fη(t)−1–measurable random variable. Consequently,

Note that while the dynamics of the abstract variable r are in general discontinuous at each Ti,
any rate associated with a compounding period greater than length zero will have continuous
dynamics.

1.2. REMARK. In a term structure model with zero volatility for zero coupon bonds B(t, Tη(t))
for all T0 ≤ t ≤ TN, the risk neutral and rolling spot LIBOR measures are identical and the
short rate interpolation (3) is arbitrage free.

PROOF: The risk neutral equivalent martingale measure is conventionally deﬁned as the measure
associated with taking the (continuously compounded) savings account as the numeraire asset,
i.e. under this measure all assets discounted by the savings account are martingales. The savings
account β(t) deﬁned by the interpolation is

β(t) = exp

For the rolling spot LIBOR measure as introduced by Jamshidian (1997), the numeraire is a roll–
over strategy in which money is invested and subsequently reinvested at spot LIBOR. Investing
one monetary unit in Ti at the spot LIBOR L(Ti, Ti) is the same as buying k zero coupon bonds

9Note that this immediately implies that all interest rates generated by the model will be positive.
10Given Assumption 1.1, (3) is simply a restatement of the identity (23) in Miltersen, Sandmann and Sondermann

(1997).

strategy is

η(t)−2(cid:89)

i=0

 B(t, Ti+1)

B(Ti, Ti+1)

(5)

(1 + δL(Ti, Ti))

Since r(s, L(Tη(s)−1, Tη(s)−1)) is FTi–measurable for Ti ≤ s < Ti+1, we have by construction
that

(cid:40)(cid:90) t

B(t, Ti+1)
B(Ti, Ti+1)

= exp

Tη(t)−1

r(s, L(Tη(s)−1, Tη(s)−1))ds

for Ti ≤ t ≤ Ti+1. Thus the numeraire processes are identical, which means that the associated
martingale measures must be11.

The interpolation deﬁned by (3) is consistent with no arbitrage if the savings account given
by (4) discounted by a numeraire asset is a martingale under the martingale measure associated
with this numeraire. It is sufﬁcient to verify this for one measure and by the above argument,
this condition is trivially fulﬁlled since the value of the savings account is identically equal to
the value of the spot LIBOR roll–over strategy.

2

In other words, since at any time t the dynamics of the shortest remaining bond to a discrete
tenor date B(t, Tη(t)) are consistent with the deterministic interpolation for the continuously
compounded short rate, all martingale properties (and thus no arbitrage) are preserved.

The observation that the roll–over strategy in spot LIBOR corresponds to a roll-over strategy

in the shortest remaining bond to a discrete tenor date also leads us to the following
1.3. REMARK. Conditional on the information at time Ti, for all FTi+1–measurable events, the
rolling spot LIBOR measure IP0 is identical to the forward measure of maturity Ti+1, i.e.

IP0{A|FTi} = IPTi+1{A|FTi}

∀ A ∈ FTi+1

Thus IP0 can be interpreted as “pasting together” a sequence of conditional forward measures.
This is valid for any arbitrage free term structure model.

PROOF: This is an immediate consequence of the fact that the time t value of the spot LIBOR
roll–over strategy (5) can be written, independently of how the discrete tenor model is extended
to continuous tenor, as a Tη(t)−1–measurable factor times B(t, Tη(t)), the numeraire of the time
Tη(t) forward measure.12

2. INTERPOLATION OF LONGER–DATED BONDS

2.1. REMARK. Given a discrete tenor model and the interpolation of the short–dated zero
coupon bonds B(t, Tη(t)), the continuous tenor model is completely speciﬁed.

11In a continuous tenor model, the market is (dynamically) complete, therefore the martingale measure for a

given numeraire is unique. For an alternative proof, cf. Lemma 3.3 in Schl¨ogl (2002b).

12For a more formal statement of this proof, see Schl¨ogl (2002b).

6

ERIK SCHL ¨OGL

PROOF: Consider a completely arbitrary pair of time points t1, t2, 0 ≤ t1 < t2 ≤ TN. The time
t1 price of a zero coupon bond maturing in t2 is given by

(6)

B(t1, t2) = B(t1, Tη(t1))

η(t2)−1(cid:89)

i=η(t1)

 B(t1, t2)

B(t1, Tη(t2))

where the short–dated bond B(t1, Tη(t1)) is given by the interpolation and the bond price quotient
on the far right by the no–arbitrage requirement that

B(t1, t2)

B(t1, Tη(t2))

= ETη(t2)[B(t2, Tη(t2))−1|Ft1]

Given a choice of interpolation (3), we can determine a function g such that
= ETη(t2)[g(L(Tη(t2)−1, Tη(t2)−1))|Ft1]

B(t1, t2)

(7)

B(t1, Tη(t2))

In the lognormal case, the right hand side can easily be evaluated numerically and depends only
on L(t1, Tη(t2)−1) and deterministic volatilities.

2

When intermediate rates with LIBOR–type compounding are linearly interpolated by day–
count fractions, (7) becomes very tractable for any model satisfying the assumptions (BP.1) and
(BP.2). Deﬁne r(s, L(Tη(s)−1, Tη(s)−1)) implicitly by setting

(cid:26)(cid:90) Ti+1

(cid:27)

r(s, L(Tη(s)−1, Tη(s)−1))ds

= 1 + (Ti+1 − t)L(Ti, Ti)

= 1 + (Tη(t2) − t2)L(t1, Tη(t2)−1)

Note that by remark 2.1, if interpolation of short–dated bonds is speciﬁed for all times, there is no
modelling freedom to interpolate longer–dated bonds, including initial model inputs. In addition
to being intuitively appealing, linear interpolation by day–count fractions has the added attraction
of providing one consistent interpolation method for all times and all maturities. Other popular
interpolation methods, such as loglinear interpolation of discount factors or linear interpolation
of continuously compounded yields, do not have this property.

3. INTRODUCING VOLATILITY FOR THE SHORT BONDS

In some applications, setting short bond volatilities to zero may be unsatisfactory. Assumption
1.1 can certainly be relaxed in any way which satisﬁes the arbitrage constraints. Remark 2.1
remains valid, i.e. to extend the model to continuous tenor it is sufﬁcient to specify the dynamics
of the short bonds. However, when the short bond dynamics are stochastic, the constraint given
by equation (3) is replaced by the more general formulation given in terms of instantaneous
forward rates in equation (23) of Miltersen, Sandmann and Sondermann (1997):

(cid:26)(cid:90) Ti+1

(cid:27)

(9)

exp

f (Ti, s)ds

= 1 + δL(Ti, Ti)

∀ i < N

Ti

where f (Ti, s) is the instantaneous forward rate at time Ti for maturity s.

One tractable and intuitively appealing way to introduce volatility for the interpolated short
bonds is to make the interpolated rates dependent on the closest remaining forward LIBOR
L(t1, Tη(t1)). Set

B(t1, Tη(t1))−1 = 1 + (Tη(t1) − t1)(α(t1)L(Tη(t1)−1, Tη(t1)−1) + (1 − α(t1))L(t1, Tη(t1)))

α(Ti + ∆) = 1

4. FORWARD MEASURES AND THE MARKOV PROPERTY

Both Miltersen, Sandmann and Sondermann (1997) and Brace, Gatarek and Musiela (1997)
set up the model of lognormal forward LIBORs in continuous tenor, i.e. equation (2) applies to
all maturities T ∈ (0, T ∗ − δ]:

dL(t, T ) = L(t, T )λ(t, T )dWT +δ(t)

with λ : IR × (0, T ∗] → IRd a deterministic function of its arguments, i.e. each L(t, T ) is
a lognormal martingale under IPT +δ for a continuum of maturities up to the time horizon T ∗.
This has the advantage that all caps and ﬂoors on δ–compounded rates will be priced by the
Black/Scholes–type formulae favoured by market practitioners.

The main disadvantage of this approach is revealed when one attempts to price instruments for
which closed form solutions are unavailable. This is already the case if the cashﬂow underlying
a derivative does not ﬁt neatly into a tenor structure of δ–compounded rates and even more so for
many popular interest rate exotics. The problem is that the continuous tenor model is inﬁnite–
dimensional even if the driving Brownian motion is one–dimensional. That is, the Markovian
state variable for such a model is the entire yield curve.13 This causes considerable difﬁculties for
all types of numerical methods. Even the method of last resort for high–dimensional problems,
Monte Carlo simulation, cannot handle inﬁnite–dimensional state variables.

From the start, it has been part of the “folk wisdom” on these models that they do not per-
mit a ﬁnite dimensional representation. Brace, Gatarek and Musiela (1997) derive the dynamics
of the continuously compounded short rate under a given set of assumptions on the volatility
structure and show that they are highly path–dependent and thus not Markovian in any ﬁnite
set of state variables. Recently, Corr (2000) formalised this conjecture and showed that when
the model is driven by a one–dimensional Brownian motion, a ﬁnite–dimensional representation
can only exist in the trivial case of zero volatility. He also derives similarly restrictive condi-
tions on the ﬁnite–dimensional representability of continuous tenor LIBOR models driven by
a multidimensional Brownian motion. These conditions, though stopping short of precluding
ﬁnite–dimensional cases, indicate that such cases are not likely to be practically useful if they do
exist.

13The term “yield curve” generally denotes the term structure interest rates for a continuum of maturities up to
the time horizon. It can be represented in several equivalent ways, for example by the curve of all continuously
compounded yields at time t, yt : (t, T ∗] → IR with yt(T ) deﬁned by

The extensions of the discrete tenor model to continuous tenor proposed in the previous sec-
tions provide a way around this problem. Since the interpolated rates are speciﬁed as functions
of the discrete tenor rates, the Markovian structure of the discrete tenor model is preserved. This
structure can be characterised as follows:

4.1. REMARK. In the discrete tenor lognormal forward LIBOR model, consider the dynamics
of a rate L(·, Ti) under some forward measure14IPTj. These dynamics are Markovian in a state
variable vector consisting of n = |j − 1 − i| + 1 rates L(·, Tk) with min(i, j − 1) ≤ k ≤
max(i, j − 1).
PROOF: Musiela and Rutkowski (1997) show that the relationship between forward measures
IPTk and IPTk+1 is given by the Radon/Nikodym derivative

dIPTk
dIPTk+1

= exp

γ(u, Tk, Tk+1)dWTk+1(u) − 1

γ2(u, Tk, Tk+1)du

where WTk+1 is a Brownian motion under IPTk+1 and

γ(t, Tk, Tk+1) =

δL(t, Tk)

λ(t, Tk)

This result does not rely on the assumption that the LIBOR volatilities λ(t, Tk) are deterministic
functions of their arguments. Rather, if the λ(t, Tk) are level dependent on some or all rates
in L(t), the Markov property still holds. Also, by remark 1.3, the above result implies that
under the rolling spot LIBOR measure, any rate L(·, Ti) is Markov in the state variable vector
{L(t, Tk)|0 ≤ k ≤ i}.

5. A LOOK AT THE INTERPOLATED INTEREST RATES

This section illustrates some of the properties of the interpolated interest rates and contrasts the
two interpolation methods proposed in the previous sections. The method described in section
2 will be referred to as method 1 or interpolation by daycount fractions; the one introduced in
section 3 will be labelled method 2 or interpolation with short bond volatility. For the inputs
used to produce each of the plots, please refer to table 1 in the appendix. The algorithm from
Brace, Musiela and Schl¨ogl (1998b) was used to generate sample paths for the evolution of the
term structure.
5.1. Term Structures. Figures 1 and 2 show how the two methods interpolate instantaneous
forward rates. For reference, the stepwise constant rates resulting from loglinear interpolation of
zero coupon bond prices are included in each plot. The instantaneous forward rates jump when
one moves from one δ–compounding period to the next. From equations (8) and (9), this is to
be expected, as the maturities of the LIBORs underlying the interpolation are different on each
interval. Instantaneous forward rates on f (0, T ) are determined on each interval T ∈ (Ti, Ti+1)
by calculating

Instantaneous forward rates give the most disaggregate representation of the term structure
and therefore effectively demonstrate the implications of the choice of interpolation method.
However, one should not judge the usefulness of a particular method from this perspective alone.
At ﬁrst glance the “sawtooth” patterns of the interpolated rates for falling term structures in
method 1 and rising term structures in method 2 seem to represent serious drawbacks to using
either method, but one should keep in mind that the instantaneous forward rates are also purely
mathematical artifacts, while the objects being modelled are market observable rates such as
LIBOR. Forward LIBORs are interpolated by

indistinguishable: Interpolation by daycount fractions and loglinear interpolation of zero coupon
bond prices results in nearly identical forward three–month LIBORs, even though the resulting
instantaneous forward rates are very different. This also implies that if one is only concerned
with rates such as forward three–month LIBORs, using loglinear interpolation of zero coupon
bond prices is for all intents and purposes arbitrage free.

Introducing short bond volatility as per method 2 makes a difference for the interpolated LI-
BORs only when the interest rate term structure changes slope. The vertical gridlines in ﬁgure 3
represent boundaries between the accrual periods in the original discrete tenor. Interpolated for-
ward LIBORs with start date in an accrual period immediately preceding a change in the slope of
the term structure depart from the linearly interpolated plots and curve “outward”. This is due to
the fact that a forward LIBOR for a given start date T is interpolated using the forward LIBOR
for the preceding and the two following discrete tenor start dates Tη(T )−1, Tη(T ) and Tη(T )+1, as
can easily be seen by appropriately inserting (10) into (13).

5.2. Rate Dynamics. The dynamics which the two methods imply for interpolated rates are il-
lustrated in Figures 4 and 5. Not only, as in the previous section, do equations (8) and (9) imply
discontinuities in the instantaneous rates in the maturity dimension, but also in the time dimen-
sion. This becomes particularly clear in the dynamics of the continuously compounded short
rate under interpolation by daycount fractions: This rate evolves deterministically within each
accrual period of the discrete tenor structure and jumps at the accrual period boundaries. For
instantaneous forward rates f (t, T ) the dynamics are stochastic as long as the time to maturity
T − t is greater than the accrual period length δ. The maturity T of the forward rate determines

FIGURE 5. Rate dynamics under interpolation with short bond volatility

which forward LIBORs are used in the interpolation, so if one considers an instantaneous for-
ward rate for a ﬁxed maturity, this rate will be interpolated from the same forward LIBORs at all
times. Since the LIBOR dynamics are modelled to be continuous, the interpolated rate will not
jump (cf. plot in upper right of Figure 4). On the other hand, holding time to maturity (TTM)
ﬁxed means that there will be jumps when the maturity T moves across a boundary between ac-
crual periods in the original discrete tenor structure. The bottom two plots in Figure 4) illustrate
this. The time to maturity of the instantaneous forward rate shown here is 1.25δ, resulting in
a jump at three–quarters of every δ–interval of the tenor structure; these points are marked by
vertical gridlines in the plot. Thus different points on the forward rate curve jump at different
times.

The same observations can be made for the dynamics of instantaneous rates under interpola-
tion with short bond volatility, as shown in Figure 5. The only qualitative difference is that now
rates with times to maturity less than δ, including the continuously compounded short rate, also
have stochastic dynamics (cf. the upper left plot of Figure 5).

As in the previous section, the observed discontinuities apply only to instantaneous rates.
Of more practical relevance is the fact that interpolated rates for accrual periods of any arbi-
trary length, for example a δ–compounded forward LIBOR L(t, T ) for a “broken date” maturity
T (cid:54)= Tη(T ), will have continuous dynamics: The instantaneous rates are continuous almost ev-
erywhere under the Lebesgue measure on the time line, thus any jumps are integrated out once
one considers accrual periods of greater than inﬁnitesimal length.

6. BROKEN DATE CAPLETS: A COMPARISON

Another point of interest is how the choice of interpolation method affects the pricing of
derivatives. In this context, the volatility of interpolated rates is of key importance. When ex-
tending the discrete tenor model to continuous tenor, one is faced with a tradeoff of completing
the model via volatilities or interest rate interpolation. By ﬁxing the volatilities of rates for all
maturities, say all δ–compounded forward LIBORs L(·, T ), T ∈ [0, T ∗−δ] as in MSS and BGM,
the model is completely speciﬁed and there is no need to interpolate interest rates. On the other
hand, when the interpolated rates are given as functions of the discrete tenor forward LIBORs,
their volatilities can be calculated by an application of Ito’s Lemma. The former approach has
the disadvantage of rather intractable dynamics for rates other the δ–compounded forward LI-
BORs, while latter implies that the “broken date” forward LIBORs L(t, T ), T (cid:54)= Tη(T ) are not
lognormal. Applying Ito’s Lemma to (13), the relative volatility of L(t, T ) is

is chosen at 1.25 times the at–the–money level and the volatility function is two–dimensional ex-
ponentially decaying.15 This choice should provide a representative example well away from the
trivial at–the–money, one–dimensional constant volatility case. The caplet prices were generated
by Monte Carlo simulation; the middle line in each plot give the Monte Carlo estimate, while
the outside lines are the conﬁdence interval boundaries two standard deviations to either side of
the Monte Carlo estimate. One million MC runs make these conﬁdence bounds reasonably tight.
We represent the caplet prices in terms of their Black/Scholes implied volatility, i.e. in terms of
the one–dimensional constant relative volatility of the underlying rate which would result in the
same caplet price. The dip in the implied volatilities is due to the fact that the interpolation of
L(T, T ) at maturity of the caplet is in part based on L(Tη(T )−1, Tη(T )−1), i.e. a rate which evolves
stochastically only until Tη(T )−1 < T . This effect is less pronounced under interpolation with
short bond volatility, as in this case L(Tη(T )−1, Tη(T )−1) plays a lesser role.

The disadvantage that the “broken date” forward LIBORs are not lognormal is greatly al-
leviated by the fact that their distribution is actually very close to lognormal. One can apply
the argument which was ﬁrst used to derive an approximate swaption formula in a lognormal
forward LIBOR model.16 Noting that the level dependence of the volatility of the interpolated
forward LIBORs varies slowly compared to the rates themselves, one can derive an approxi-
mate closed–form solution for the “broken date” caplet by calculating the level dependence with
respect to the initial rates, e.g. for method 1 by setting

7. CONCLUSION

Extending the models of market observable interest rates from discrete to continuous tenor by
interpolation is particularly useful in implementations where there are some ﬁnancial products
which must be priced numerically, as the Markovian structure of the discrete tenor model is
preserved. It is important to note that the interpolation method cannot be chosen arbitrarily for
all maturities. Rather, it must take into account the relevant no–arbitrage conditions.

Shifting the focus from instantaneous forward rates to market observables such as forward
LIBOR, the rate dynamics implied by the proposed interpolation methods are reasonable. These
methods supply alternatives to the continuous tenor versions of the lognormal forward rate Mar-
ket Models proposed in the literature and in those cases where moving to continuous tenor by
interpolation entails a loss of tractability, for example for “broken date” caplets, very accurate
approximations exist.

APPENDIX: MODEL PARAMETERS

To generate the plots, two volatility speciﬁcations λ1 and λ2 were used:
∀ t < T < T ∗
∀ t < T < T ∗

(cid:18) 0.6e−0.8(T−t)

λ1(t, T ) = 0.3

λ2(t, T ) =

(cid:19)

0.1e−0.01(T−t)

The length δ of the discrete tenor accrual period is in all cases 0.25.

Three initial term structures of discrete tenor forward LIBORs are considered:
(1) Linearly increasing from 4% at 0 years up to 6% at 5 years and then linearly decreasing

down to 4% at 10 years.
