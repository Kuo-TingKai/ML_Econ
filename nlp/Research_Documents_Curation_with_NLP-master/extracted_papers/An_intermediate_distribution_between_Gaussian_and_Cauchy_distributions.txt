Abstract

In this paper, we construct an intermediate distribution linking the Gaussian and the

Cauchy distribution. We provide the probability density function and the corresponding char-

acteristic function of the intermediate distribution. Because many kinds of distributions have

no moment, we introduce weighted moments. Speciﬁcally, we consider weighted moments

under two types of weighted functions: the cut-oﬀ function and the exponential function.

Through these two types of weighted functions, we can obtain weighted moments for almost

all distributions. We consider an application of the probability density function of the inter-

mediate distribution on the spectral line broadening in laser theory. Moreover, we utilize the

intermediate distribution to the problem of the stock market return in quantitative ﬁnance.

tribution; weighted moment; spectral line broadening; stock market return

Introduction

In statistics, the Gaussian distribution is a standard distribution satisfying the central limit the-
orem; the Cauchy distribution, also called the Lorentzian distribution, however, typically fails to
be tamed by the central limit theorem [1]. In the meantime, these two kinds of distributions both
belong to inﬁnitely divisible distributions [2, 3, 4]. They have some similarities, such as unimodal-
ity, symmetry and the same domain of deﬁnition. Such similar properties are so attractive that
stimulate one to ﬁnd an intermediate distribution to link up the Gaussian and the Cauchy distri-
bution. The Student-t distribution [5] is the ﬁrst distribution that realizes the purpose linking the
two distributions. Neverthelessthe Student-t distribution is not the unique one. In this paper, we
provide another kind of distribution linking the Gaussian and the Cauchy distribution.

First, we introduce an intermediate distribution which can reduce to the Gaussian and the
Cauchy distribution at some certain values of a parameter. Second, instead of conventional mo-
ments, we consider the weighted moment of a distribution. Many distributions have no moments

since the moment of such distributions diverges. To seek moments, a weighted moment is intro-
duced. By the weighted moment, rather than the conventional moment, one can calculate the
moment in almost all kinds of distributions, such as Gaussian, Cauchy, and Student-t distribu-
tions and the distribution provided in the present paper. Third, we give two applications of the
intermediate distribution: one is in laser theory and the other is in quantitative ﬁnance.

Speciﬁcally, as is well known, each probability density function (PDF) corresponds a character-
istic function uniquely through a Fourier transformation [6, 7, 8], which enlightens one to construct
a PDF starting from a characteristic function. From this viewpoint, we provide a distribution that
bridges the gap between the Gaussian and the Cauchy distribution by analyzing their characteristic
functions in this paper.

Next, we introduce a weighted moment, because the conventional moment fails to converge
in many distributions [6], e.g., the Cauchy distribution does not have conventional moments.
Nevertheless, the moment is one of the most important concepts in statistics. Many properties are
reﬂected by each order moment, such as deviations and variances. If a distribution does not have
moments, it makes diﬃculties to discuss the properties described by the moment. Therefore, we
consider the weighted moment to overcome such a defect. We, speciﬁcally, discuss two types of
weighted moments in this paper.

When considering complex systems, the concept of generalized distribution is widely discussed.
An important generalization of the Gaussian distribution is the Tsallis distribution [9, 10, 11]
(the Student-t distribution mentioned above is a special case of the Tsallis distribution). Recent
researches show that a dissipative optical lattice system will display the Tsallis distribution [12].
In quantitative physics, it is shown that one can construct stock price models based on the Tsallis
distribution [13]. In addition, some other kinds of generalized statistics and the applications are
also discussed in the literature [14, 15].

Furthermore, we suggest an application of the intermediate distribution on spectral line broad-
ening in laser theory. The homogeneous broadening due to collisions and spontaneous emissions
is approximated by the Cauchy distribution, and the inhomogeneous broadening due to Doppler
eﬀects is approximated by the Gaussian distribution [16]. Since the two kinds of broadenings
exist simultaneously, we suggest to use the intermediate distribution to describe the spectral line
broadening. In general, a realistic system always cannot be exactly described by an ideal theoret-
ical model. Therefore, some intermediate models are suggested to describe complex systems. For
example, it is found that a magnetic system obeys a kind of intermediate statistics rather than
Bose-Einstein statistics [17]. Moreover, some composite particles composed of some fermions may
behave like bosons and obey Bose-Einstein statistics when they are far from each other; when they
come closer together, however, the fermions in the composite particles can feel each other, and the
statistics of the composite particles will deviate from exact Bose-Einstein statistics [18]. Such a
composite-particle system will obey a certain kind of intermediate statistics. For this reason, some
intermediate theories are considered [19, 20, 21, 22].

At last, we apply the intermediate distribution to describe the stock market return in quantita-
tive ﬁnance. The stock market return is the return that we obtain from stock market by buying and
selling stocks or get dividends by the company whose stock you hold. Stock market returns include
two parts: capital gain and dividend income. In the Black-Scholes stock option pricing model [23]
and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) [24, 25, 26], the stock market price is assumed to
follow lognormal distribution, which means that stock market returns follow the Gaussian distri-
bution. Nevertheless, in real world, stock market returns disobey the Gaussian distribution. The

2

characteristics of stock market return distribution is sharp peak and fat tails. The intermediate
distribution can ﬁt the stock market return better than the Gaussian distribution. Moreover, in
the ﬁtting results, we also compare the intermediate distribution with the q-Gaussian distribution,
which generalizes the Gaussian distribution in statistics [27]. The distribution of the stock market
return plays a fundamental role in pricing theory. Based on the intermediate distribution, we can
price the stock price and the option in line with the realistic.

The structure of this paper is as follows.

In section 2, an intermediate distribution linking
the Gaussian and the Cauchy distribution is constructed.
In section 3, the weighted moment
and some properties of the moment are discussed. In section 4, a function is introduced to link
the intermediate and the Gaussian distribution smoothly.
In section 5, an application of the
intermediate distribution to spectral line broadening in laser theory is discussed. In section 6, the
intermediate distribution is utilized to ﬁt the probability density function with respect to the stock
market return. The conclusion and outlook are given in Section 7.

2 The Construction of the intermediate distribution

In this section, we introduce an intermediate distribution. The PDF of the intermediate distribu-
tion is

p (x, µ, σ, ν) =

cos(cid:18) x − µ

ν

(ν > 0, σ > 0)

and the corresponding characteristic function is

fν (k) = exp(cid:26)ikµ −

σ2

ν |k| + σ2(cid:18)1 −

1

ν(cid:19) [exp (−ν |k|) − 1](cid:27) .

(1)

(2)

Such a distribution will recover the Gaussian and the Cauchy distribution when ν → 0 and ν → 1,
respectively.

In the following, we deduce the PDF and the corresponding characteristic function in detail.

2.1 The characteristic function of the intermediate distribution

At the earliest, the unique general formula for any characteristic function of inﬁnitely divisible
distribution with ﬁnite variance was found by Kolmogorov. Levy and Khintchine generalized
Kolmogorov’s result and discovered the famous Levy-Khintchine formula [4, 6, 8, 28]. The Levy-
Khintchine formula is also valid to all inﬁnitely divisible distributions.

According to the Levy-Khintchine formula, all characteristic functions of inﬁnitely divisible

distributions can be represented by [4, 6, 8, 28]

f (k) = exp(cid:20)ikµ +Z +∞

−∞ (cid:18)eiky − 1 −

iky

1 + y2(cid:19) 1 + y2

y2 dG (y)(cid:21) ,

(3)

where µ is a real constant and G (y) is a real, bounded, and nondecreasing function of y. Diﬀerent
G (y)’s generate diﬀerent distributions.

What we want to do is to introduce a function linking Gaussian and Cauchy distributions. We

construct the function G (y, ν) as

G (y, ν) =

σ2
π

arctan

y
ν

+

σ2
2

, (ν > 0, σ > 0).

(4)

3

ObviouslyG (y, ν) is a real, bounded, and nondecreasing function of y from −∞ to +∞. Because
G (y, ν) satisﬁes the requirements of the Levy-Khintchine formula, it corresponds to a characteristic
function of a certain distribution. The function G (y, ν) recovers the characteristic functions of
Gaussian and Cauchy distributions when ν → 0 and ν → 1, respectively:

G (y, 0) = GGauss (y) = σ2Θ (y) ,

G (y, 1) = GCauchy (y) =

σ2
π

arctan y +

σ2
2

,

(5)

(6)

where Θ (y) is the step function. In this paper, the intermediate distribution is generated from
G (y, ν) in Eq. (4).

For simplicityintroduce

H (y) =

∂G
∂y

Inserting H (y) into the Levy-Khintchine formula (3), we have

(10)

(11)

Finallythe characteristic function of the intermediate distribution generated by Eq. (4) is shown
as Eq. (2).

2.2 The PDF of the intermediate distribution

Now, we deduce the PDF of the intermediate distribution corresponding to the characteristic
function given by Eq. (2).

Facilitating the inverse Fourier transformation, we rewrite fν (k) as

fν (k) = exp(cid:26)ikµ −

3 The weighted moment

(14)

(15)

In this section, we introduce weighted moments and discuss their behaviors.

The reason why we consider the weighted moment is that the conventional moment diverges
in many distributions, such as the Cauchy distribution. To obtain and compare the moment
between diﬀerent distributions, we introduce the weighted function to seek a convergent moment.
A parameter is used to adjust the weighted function. When the parameter takes a certain value,
the weighted function reduces to 1 and coincides with the conventional one. Speciﬁcally, we discuss
the weighted moment with the cut-oﬀ weighted function and the exponential weighted function.

The moment is one of the essential concepts in statistics. It is because that the even order
moment, especially the second order moment, reﬂects the deviation of a quantity that is estimated.
It is inconvenient for us to analyze the deviation of this quantity that a distribution does not have
the even order moments. Moreover, the mean value of a quantity can be expanded as a series of
the moments since the quantity can be technically expanded as a power series.

3.1 The moment and the weighted moment

In this section, we introduce the weighted moment.

The central moment in statistics is deﬁned as

hxmi =Z +∞

−∞

(x − µ)m p (x − µ) dx =Z +∞

−∞

xmp (x) dx

(m ≥ 0) .

(16)

5

Note that one also considers another kind of moment, the origin moment hxmiorigin =R +∞
with m ≥ 0, in statistics. We can easily ﬁnd that the value of the origin moment depends on the
central site x = µ of the distribution, while the central moment is independent on the site x = µ.
Thus, the central moment is more natural than the origin moment. We will only discuss the central
moment in this paper.

−∞ xmp (x − µ) dx

If p (x) is an even function, the Cauchy principal value of the odd order moments vanishes

The even order moment reads

−∞

(cid:10)x2n+1(cid:11) = PZ +∞
(cid:10)x2n(cid:11) =Z +∞

−∞

x2n+1p (x) dx = 0, (n = 0, 1, 2,··· ) .

x2np (x) dx, (n = 0, 1, 2,··· ) .

The Gaussian distribution has all even order central moments:

where Γ (z) is the Euler gamma function. As is well known, the Cauchy distribution, however,
does not has central moments. The intermediate distribution given by Eq. (1), like the Cauchy
distribution, has no central moments. The 2n-th moment of Eq. (1)

In order to ﬁnd a quantity to play the role of moments to the distribution which does not have

xmw (x, λ) p (x, 0, σ, ν) dx,

(21)

by introducing a symmetrical weighted function w (x, λ). Since w (x, λ) and p (x, 0, σ, ν) are sym-
metrical, the Cauchy principal value of the odd order moments vanishes, and, then, only the even
order moment

(cid:10)x2n(cid:11)w =Z +∞

−∞

needs to be considered.

x2nw (x, λ) p (x, 0, σ, ν) dx,

(n = 0, 1, 2,··· )

(22)

In the following, we consider two weighted functions.

3.2 The weighted moment with the cut-oﬀ weighted function w (x, a) =

Θ (x + a) − Θ (x − a)

In this section, we consider a cut-oﬀ weighted function,

The even order weighted moment with the weighted function (23) is then

w (x, a) = Θ (x + a) − Θ (x − a) .

4 An alternative construction of the intermediate distribu-

tion

In this section, we suggest another construction of the PDF of the intermediate distribution, which
links the intermediate distribution and the Gaussian distribution smoothly.

In the PDF of the intermediate distribution, Eq. (1), the points ν = 0 is a removable singularity.
According to the analysis in the above section, the behavior of the moment depends on the value
of the parameter ν. The distribution have no moments unless ν → 0 so that the intermediate
distribution, Eq. (1), reduces to the Gaussian distribution. What we want to do is to seek a certain
way that when the parameter ν runs smoothly from a constant ν0 to 0, the distribution travels
smoothly from the intermediate distribution to the Gaussian distribution. Especially, when ν0 = 1,
the distribution will travel smoothly from the Cauchy distribution to the Gaussian distribution.

Speciﬁcally, we insert a smooth function h (t, ν0, a, b) into the PDF of the intermediate distri-

bution, Eq. (1), and then have

p (x, µ, σ, ν0, t, a, b)

The ﬁgures of h (t, ν0, a, b) and s (t, a, b) are shown in Figure 1.

When t ≥ b, h (t, ν0, a, b) = 0, and the PDF Eq. (34) reduces to the Gaussian PDF. When
ν0 = 1 and t ≤ a, h (t, 1, a, b) = 1, the PDF Eq. (34) reduces to the Cauchy PDF. When t runs
from a to b, the distribution travels from the intermediate distribution to the Gaussian distribution
smoothly. Especially, when ν0 = 1, the distribution travels from the Cauchy distribution to the
Gaussian distribution.

5 Application to the problem of the spectral line broadening

in laser theory

In this section, we apply the intermediate distribution introduced in the present paper to the
spectral line broadening in laser theory.

In laser theory, the spectral line broadening is a phenomenon due to photons emitted or ab-
sorbed in a narrow frequency range. The spectral line broadening of laser can be approximated
by a distribution. The Cauchy distribution and Gaussian distribution are often used to describe
the broadening: the Cauchy distribution is used to describe the homogeneous broadening; the
Gaussian distribution is used to describe the inhomogeneous broadening. Nevertheless, the ho-
mogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening exist simultaneously. That is to say, in a system, the
broadening is neither homogeneous nor inhomogeneous, but between homogeneous and inhomoge-
neous. Therefore, we need a function to describe the mixed broadening. In this paper, we suggest
that, instead of the Gaussian and the Cauchy distribution, one can use an intermediate distribution
to describe the spectral line broadening.

In the semiclassical approach of spectral line broadening in laser system, the material and the
light are described by quantum mechanics and the Maxwell equations, respectively, to calculate

the interaction between the medium and the light [31]. Under the electric dipole approximation,
the rate of absorption and stimulated emission of the medium between two energy levels is [16]

W =

π

3n2ǫ02 |p|2 ρg (ω − ω0) ,

(37)

where n is the refractive index of the material, ǫ0 is the vacuum permittivity, p is the electric dipole
moment, ρ is the energy density of the light, ω0 is the frequency coinciding with the interval of two
energy levels deﬁned by ω0 = |E2 − E1| /. The function g (ω − ω0) in Eq. (37) can be expressed
by a probability density distribution using to describe the broadening near the frequency ω0. It is
clear that the rate of absorption and stimulated emission is determined by the function g (ω − ω0).
If the life time of the system at a certain energy level is inﬁnite, g (ω − ω0) reduces to δ (ω − ω0),
where δ (x) is the Dirac delta function. In a realistic system, the life time of an excited state is
ﬁnite. There are many kinds of factors eﬀecting on a laser system, such as collisions, spontaneous
emission, Doppler eﬀect, etc. These factors lead to the broadening, and make g (ω − ω0) deviate
from δ (ω − ω0). This can be directly measured in experiments [32]. We usually use full width at
half maximum ωF W HM of g (ω − ω0) to describe the eﬀect of the broadening. The reciprocal of
full width at half maximum ωF W HM indicates the life time of the level.

There are two kinds of mechanisms in spectral line broadening in a laser system [33]. One is
homogeneous which arises from collisions and spontaneous emission, and it can be described by the
Cauchy distribution. The other is inhomogeneous broadening which arises from the Doppler eﬀect
and the dislocation of the material. The Doppler broadening can be described by the Gaussian
distribution, but the broadening caused by the dislocation has no proper expression. In general,
homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadenings appear in a laser system simultaneously. Therefore,
the function g (ω − ω0) is actually between the Cauchy and Gaussian PDF.

Since the intermediate distribution given by Eq. (1) is between the Gaussian and the Cauchy
distributions, we suggest that one can use the intermediate PDF, Eq. (1), to describe the function
g (ω − ω0). Speciﬁcally, take

g (ω − ω0) = p (ω, ω0, σ, ν) ,

Figure 3: The ﬁtting of the experimental line width data with the intermediate, the Gaussian, and
the Cauchy distribution. The data are taken from Ref. [34]

where p (x, µ, σ, ν) is deﬁned by the Eq. (1). The parameters σ and ν play the roles of ﬁtting
constants. The line shape of the broadenings which have the same full width at half maximum
ωF W HM is shown in Figure 2.

We import a set of data of hydrogen Zeeman-Stark line broadening from Figure 2 (b) in Ref.
[34] and ﬁt them with the intermediate, Cauchy, and Gaussian distribution, respectively. The
data and the ﬁtting results are plotted in Figure 3. From the ﬁtting results, the intermediate
distribution describes the line broadening better than the Gaussian and the Cauchy distribution.

6 Application to stock market returns

Gaussian distributed return is one of the most important assumptions in quantitative ﬁnance
[24, 25, 26]. The key reason why we make this assumption is that the Gaussian distribution is
easy to handle and we can get a lot of analytical results. The Gaussian distribution assumption,
however, has got much criticism for its failure to describe the real world. Stock market returns in
real world have sharp peak and fat tails distribution, which means that the probability of stock
market crash is high.
If we take the Gaussian distribution, the stock market crash is almost
impossible to happen. Nevertheless, the stock market crash is not far away from us, like the Great
Depression and the Black Thursday. We know that the Gaussian distribution does not have those
characteristics. Thus we deem that the Gaussian distribution is a poor model of stock market
return, and it is inappropriate to use the Gaussian distribution to describe the stock market. In
this section, the market return is ﬁtted by the intermediate distribution. We use S&P 500 price
index, Dow Jones index, Nasdaq composite index, and Nikkei 225 index. The daily stock prices
are obtained from Wind Database – a staple ﬁnancial database. All those indexes are price index,
and we compute the return from this formula

where rt is the return and pt is the stock price.

pt − pt−1

The q-Gaussian distribution is an important distribution, which has wide-ranging applications
in various research scopes, as well as ﬁnancial physics [35, 36, 37]. The q-Gaussian distribution is
derived from the minimum Tsallis entropy [38, 39]

where Aq =q 1−q

When q → 0, the q-Gaussian distribution returns to the Gaussian distribution, Eq. (14).

2q (cid:17) /Γ(cid:16) 1

q Γ(cid:16) 1−q

Making use of the intermediate, the q-Gaussian and the Gaussian distribution to ﬁt the data, we
plot the results in Figure 4-7. We can ﬁnd that the intermediate and the q-Gaussian distribution
are much better than the Gaussian distribution. The real data have sharp peak and fat tails
and the intermediate and the q-Gaussian distribution both give good ﬁts to this phenomenon.
From these ﬁgures we can also ﬁnd that the intermediate distribution is somewhat more suitable
to describe the peak of the data of stock market returns, especially for the Nikkei index, and
the log-log plots indicate that the q-Gaussian distribution describes the fat tails better than the
intermediate distribution.

7 Conclusions and outlook

In this paper, we construct an intermediate distribution between the Gaussian and the Cauchy
distribution. We provide the PDF and the corresponding characteristic function of the intermediate
distribution. The moment, on the one hand, is used to show the mean value and the deviation
to the mean value; on the other hand, is used as the terms of a series of a quantity. Because
many kinds of distributions have no moment, we introduce the weighted moment. We calculate
the weighted moment with the cut-oﬀ and the exponential weighted function, speciﬁcally. With
the help of a smooth function, we give another expression of the intermediate distribution.

As an application, the spectral line broadening in laser theory can be approximated by a
PDF. Since the homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadenings exist simultaneously, we suggest to
describe the line shape function by the intermediate PDF, instead of the Cauchy or the Gaussian
PDF. The intermediate distribution is not only useful in spectral line broadening of laser but
maybe more attractive in ﬁnancial physics [40, 41, 42]. A number of theoretical and empirical
studies indicate that the majority of ﬁnancial data are estimated as sharp peak and fat tails PDFs,
but the Gaussian distribution is not general enough to account the excess kurtosis [43, 44, 45].
Our result shows that the intermediate and q-Gaussian distribution, however, comparing with the
Gaussian distribution, are more suitable for ﬁtting the ﬁnancial data. The ﬁtting results show
that the intermediate distribution is somewhat more suitable to describe the kurtosis and the q-
Gaussian distribution is more suitable to describe the tails, respectively. Such results show that
the intermediate distribution, like the q-Gaussian distribution, can also be utilized in ﬁnancial
physics. In further study, we can use the intermediate distribution to price the option, and get the
true value of the option. Option is one kind of derivatives which is the core of pricing theory. We
also can price other derivatives whose price is based on the stock market return.
