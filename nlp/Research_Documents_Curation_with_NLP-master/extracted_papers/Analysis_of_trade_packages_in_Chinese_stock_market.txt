This paper conducts an empirically study on the trade package composed of a sequence of
consecutive purchases or sales of 23 stocks in Chinese stock market. We investigate the prob-
ability distributions of the execution time, the number of trades and the total trading volume
of trade packages, and analyze the possible scaling relations between them. Quantitative dif-
ferences are observed between the institutional and individual investors. The trading proﬁle
of trade packages is investigated to reveal the preference of large trades on trading volumes
and transaction time of the day, and the diﬀerent proﬁles of two types of investors imply that
institutions may be more informed than individuals. We further analyze the price impacts
of both the entire trade packages and the individual transactions inside trade packages. We
ﬁnd the price impact of trade packages is nonnegligible over the period of the execution time
and it may have a power-law relation with the total trading volume. The price impact of the
transactions inside trade packages displays a U-shaped proﬁle with respect to the time t of the
day, and also shows a power-law dependence on their trading volumes. The trading volumes of
the transactions inside trade packages made by institutions have a stronger impact on current
returns, but the following price reversals persist over a relatively shorter horizon in comparison
with those by individuals.

Introduction

The study of price impact of trading on stock exchanges is known as one of the central topics in
ﬁnancial economics. It has been veriﬁed by many empirical studies that large trades generally
have a strong impact on stock price (Ying 1966, Karpoﬀ 1987, Wood et al. 1985, Gallant et al.
1992, Chan and Fong 2000, Lillo et al. 2003, Lim and Coggins 2005, Næs and Skjeltorp 2006,
Zhou 2011). The single execution of a large order will lead to a large impact on stock price
and increase the investor’s cost. Therefore, large orders are usually split into small pieces,
and executed at an extended period of time to minimize their price impact. These sequences
of trades are called trade packages (Chan and Lakonishok 1995, Gallagher and Looi 2006,
Giambona and Golec 2010), hidden orders (Vaglica et al. 2008, Moro et al. 2009, Vaglica et al.
2010), or metaorders (Farmer et al. 2011). Growing evidence shows that large trades play a ma-
jor role in trading in stock markets, which represent a large fraction of market’s total trading
volume (Keim and Madhavan 1996, Jain 2003, Prino et al. 2007, Gregoriou 2008, Vaglica et al.
2010).

A large amount of research has been conducted on the large trades of institutional investors,
most of which consider the individual trade as the basis unit of analysis in the study of its price
impact (Keim and Madhavan 1996, Prino et al. 2007, Gregoriou 2008, Kraus and Stoll 1972,
Aitken and Frino 1996, Gemmill 1996, Saar 2001, Chiyachantana et al. 2004). However, an in-
stitutional order is often broken up into a sequence of consecutive trades, and its total volume
occupies a large fraction of the stock’s trading volume. Therefore, it may be better to treat the
sequence of trades as the basis unit of analysis in the study of institutional trades. The earli-
est study of trade packages may be traced back to the study by Chan and Lakonishok (1995).
They analyze the price impact of the entire sequence of trades in Now York and American
Stock Exchanges, and ﬁnd that the price impact is related to package size and trade complex-
ity. Gallagher and Looi (2006) study the abnormal returns for trade packages of the Australian
equity managers to estimate their trade performance. Giambona and Golec (2010) study the
wrong trades inside trade packages by large intuitional insider. Recently, Vaglica et al. (2008),
Moro et al. (2009), and Vaglica et al. (2010) try to study the market impact of trade packages
identiﬁed by the continuous increase or decrease of a ﬁrm’s stock inventory. Farmer et al. (2011)
propose a theoretical model to study the permanent impact of large trading orders. The appli-
cation of such research lies in the study of optimal execution of large orders to minimize the
trading costs of institutional investors (Almgren 2003, Obizhaeva and Wang 2010, Alfonsi et al.
2010).

Many articles have addressed the question of how to measure the price impact of trade pack-
ages. Chan and Lakonishok (1995) study the price impact during trade packages using the av-
erage, open and close price on the ﬁrst and last day of the trade package. Following their
works, Gallagher and Looi (2006) measure the impact over an extended period of time before
the start and after the end of the package. Instead, Vaglica et al. (2008), Moro et al. (2009),
and Vaglica et al. (2010) study the price impact of trade packages using the transaction data,
measured as the diﬀerence between the prices of the ﬁst and last transaction of the trade package.
In this paper, we are not only interested in the market impact of the entire trade package, but
also concerned about the impact of the individual transactions inside packages. For the study of
price impact of isolated large trades, an early study measures the price impact using the close
price a few days before and after the trades (Kraus and Stoll 1972). Keim and Madhavan (1996)
use the close price on the trading day prior to and after block trades. In stead of using the close
price, recent studies choose the transaction price to estimate the price impact of individual trades,
e.g., the average price of several transactions prior to and after block trades (Prino et al. 2007,
Gemmill 1996), or the transaction price immediately prior to and after block trades (Gregoriou

2008).

To the best of our knowledge, the empirical study on trade packages in Chinese stock market
has not been conducted. This may due to the diﬃculty of collection of proprietary data. We
have the ultrahigh-frequency data of 23 liquid stocks on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in year
2003. The data contain the information about all the transactions of each investor, including the
trading price, the trading volume, the transaction time, etc. We use the trading records of the
23 stocks as our sample data, and analyze the price impact of trade packages and the individual
transactions inside using the transaction price.

Unlike

the

data

provided

by

the Plexus Group

(Keim and Madhavan

1995,
Chiyachantana et al. 2004), we are not directly informed of the large institutional trades
from our database. Proxy methods are used to detect the trade packages, for instance, a
technical detection algorithm based on the inventory time evolution of ﬁrms (Vaglica et al.
2008, Moro et al. 2009, Vaglica et al. 2010). In the present work, we follow the ideal introduced
in Chan and Lakonishok (1995), Gallagher and Looi (2006) and Giambona and Golec (2010),
and deﬁne the trade package as a sequence of mostly buy or sell trades with less than a n-day
break between chronologically adjacent trades. Consistent with the results revealed in previous
studies, we observe similar results for various length of break n = 1, 5, 10 days, other than some
quantitative diﬀerences.

So far, previous studies of trade packages primarily focus on the large trades made by insti-
tutional investors. Our database includes the trading records for both institutional and indi-
vidual investors, identiﬁed by a particular code denoting the investor type. Large trades made
by individuals, e.g., private equity investments, can also be detected using the same detection
rules. Therefore, we can also study the price impact of large individual trading. In addition,
our present study further conﬁrms the nonlinear power-law relation between the price returns
and trading volumes, as revealed in many empirical studies (Hasbrouck 1991, Plerou et al. 2002,
Chordia and Subrahmanyam 2004, Zhou 2011). Another purpose is to study the price impact
of individual transactions inside trade packages. We ﬁnd that the individual transactions have
a strong positive impact on the current price and a temporary negative impact on the following
prices, though the cumulative impact of the entire trade package is nonnegligible over the whole
period of execution time.

The remainder paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce our database, the
investigated variables of trade packages and their summary statistics. Sections 3 studies the
statistic properties of trade packages, including the probability distributions of the investigated
variables and their scaling relations. In Section 4, we attempt to study the trading proﬁle of
trade packages by analyzing the mean trading volume, transaction probability and the total
trading volume with respect to the time of a day. The price impacts of the entire trade packages
and the individual transactions inside trade packages are carefully studied in Section 6. Section
7 summarizes our ﬁndings.

2. Data and investigated variables

2.1. Data sample

The data used in our study comprise 23 liquid stocks traded on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange
(SZSE), one of the two stock exchanges in mainland China. The SZSE was established on De-
cember 1, 1990 and started its operations on July 3, 1991. The SZSE has two separate markets
including A-shares and B-shares. A-shares are common stocks issued by mainland Chinese com-
panies, subscribed and traded in Chinese currency Renminbi (RMB), purchased and sold by

Chinese nationals and approved foreign investors. The A-share market was launched in 1990
and opened only to domestic investors before 2003. B-shares are also issued by mainland Chi-
nese companies, but traded in foreign currencies. B-shares carry a face value denominated in
RMB. The B-share Market was launched in 1992 and was restricted to foreign investors before
February 19, 2001. It has been opened to Chinese investors since then.

We mainly study the data of 23 stocks in A-share market of the SZSE in year 2003. Up
to the end of 2003, there have been 491 A-share stocks listed on the SZSE. The total market
capitalization of A-share market was 1.2 billion RMB and the ﬂoat market capitalization was 0.45
billion RMB. Our sample stocks were part of the 40 constituent stocks composing the Shenzhen
Stock Exchange Component Index in 2003. These 23 stocks are representative in a variety of
industry sectors, as shown in Table 1. The total transaction amount Atot, the ﬂoat capitalization
Cf lo and the total market capitalization Ctot, in unit of million RMB, of 23 stocks in year 2003
are also listed in Table 1. For instance, the total transaction amount Atot of stock 000001 in 2003
is 23847.6 million RMB, and the ﬂoat capitalization Cf lo and total market capitalization Ctot of
the same stock are 12 and 16.6 million RMB respectively. The Atot is three orders of magnitude
larger than Cf lo and Ctot. Similar phenomenon are observed in all the 23 stocks, which implies
that the average transaction amount per day of a certain stock almost approximates to its total
market capitalization. This indicates that the market was relatively active in 2003, though it
was in the middle of a ﬁve-year bear market (Zhou and Sornette 2004).

The SZSE generally opens from Monday to Friday, but closes for public holidays and other
dates as announced by the China Securities Regulatory Commission. We mainly consider the
continuous double auction operates from 9:30 to 11:30 and 13:00 to 15:00. Based upon the orders
of submission and cancelation, the transaction is automatically executed according to price-time
priority matching rule. The trading records of 23 stocks are consequently extracting from the
original database of order ﬂows. It is worthwhile to point out that the account number for
each investor is provided under the condition that the name of the investor involved is removed
from the data. Therefore, we can obtain the sequence of transactions for each investor, which
contains the information about the trade price, the trading volume, and the transaction time.
We treat those transactions executed by a certain investor at the same time but traded with
diﬀerent investors as one trade for this investor. Moreover, in our database each market member
is endowed with a code identifying the investor type, i.e., institution and individual. That makes
it possible to compare the trading dynamics between those two types of investors.

Table 1 presents summary statistics of the trading records of 23 stocks, including the number
of investors Ninv, the total number of trades Ntra, the mean, median and standard deviation of
the number of trades per investor. The number of investors Ninv varies in the range from 34814
(stock 000720) to 533752 (stock 000001), and the total number of trades Ntra varies in the range
from 194644 (stock 000541) to 2925841 (stock 000001). We integrate the trading records of the
23 stocks, and the sample size is 18597649 trades in total. For most of the stocks analyzed in
our study, the mean number of trades for each investor is around 5, and the median is slightly
smaller, about 2 or 3. The standard deviation of the number of trades per investor ﬂuctuates in
a wide range between 9.3 and 35.4, and the large values of the standard deviation indicate big
diﬀerences between the trades number of diﬀerent investors.

2.2.

Identiﬁcation of trade packages

The trade package is deﬁned as a sequence of mostly buy (sell) trades of a stock, and it is
generally ended by a speciﬁc break time between chronologically adjacent trades. The selection
of the break time does not sensitively aﬀect the results, only brings a quantitative diﬀerence.
Giambona and Golec (2010) use an eight-day break to analyze the trade package made by Gabelli

asset management company, and they ﬁnd that the package groupings are not sensitive to the
length of the break. In fact, there is no much diﬀerence observed for the break length longer
than 5 days, as shown in the following context. In this paper, we present the results of trade
packages ended by the break of 1,5,10 days separately.

Pbuy vi

P vi

> θ or Psell vi
P vi

Denote vi as the trading volume of a certain transaction i inside a trade package, we consider
> θ. The
the trade package consisted mostly of purchases or sales, i.e.,
parameter θ is set to be 0.75 in the present study. For other values θ > 0.75 we observe similar
results, consistent with the results found by Vaglica et al. (2008). The investors, who occasionally
trade in stock market, may have packages containing very few trades which also satisfy the above
condition. To avoid considering those investors who are unlikely to split their trades, we choose
relatively active investors and restrict the packages with Nm > 5, where Nm is the number of
trades done through market orders. Market orders are submitted by investors who are urgent
to trade, and are executed immediately after the submission. Those orders waited in the limit
order book and executed later are limit orders. The threshold 5 is close to the mean number
of trades per investor shown in Table 1. If a package of trades has Nm larger than the mean
number of trades per investor, we regard it to be a trade package made by an active investor.

Following the detecting rules: (i) packages are separated by a n-day break, (ii) at least 75%
of the trading volumes in the package are buying or selling volumes, (iii) the number of trades
executed as market orders in the package should be larger than 5, we ﬁnd out the trade packages
of 23 stocks. We integrate the package samples over all the 23 stocks. As shown in Table 2, there
are 1187, 1066, 923 trade packages made by institutions detected for the break of 1, 5, 10 days.

For individuals, the number of trade packages detected is larger, 35187, 37924, 35319 for the
break of 1, 5, 10 days. This may because that the number of individual investors is much larger
than the number of institutional investors. There are 3215246 individuals and 67054 institutions
traded in the 23 stocks in year 2003. This may also be explained by their diﬀerent ways of trading
in stock market. Institutions trade strictly following their trading strategies, and they do not
trade as frequently as individuals.

The variables characterizing the trade packages are deﬁned as following: (i) The execution
time T of the trade package, measured as the interval between the ﬁrst and last transaction of
the trade package, in unit of one second. (ii) The number of trades N within the trade package.

i=1 vi.

(iii) The total trading volume of the trade package, denoted as V =PN

Table 2 gives the means of the execution time, the number of trades and the total trading
volumes for both institutions and individuals. The mean of the execution time hT i shows an
increasing tendency as the increase of the break time separating packages. It is 5973, 57259,
113779 seconds for institutions, and 5553, 58701, 117811 seconds for individuals for the break of
1, 5, 10 days. The mean of the number of trades hN i for institutions is 41, 54, 56 for the break of
1, 5, 10 days, larger than 32, 35, 36 those for individuals. Similarly, the mean of the total trading
volumes hV i for institutions is 177311, 224872, 236013 for the break of 1, 5, 10 days, larger than
121841, 124456, 124004 those for individuals. This implies the institutions have capitalization
on average larger than individuals, and need more transactions to accomplish the purchase or
sale of large amounts of shares. In general, a trade package consists of a sequence of 30 − 60
consecutive transactions, and each transaction on average has 4000 shares. Therefore, the trade
packages analyzed in our study are of extremely large size.

3. Statistics properties of trade packages

3.1. Probability distributions of variables characterizing trade packages

Vaglica et al. (2008) study three most capitalized stocks traded on the Spanish Stock Exchange
(BME), and reveal that the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the variables T , N and
V have power-law tails with exponents lying in an interval [1.2, 2.3]. An extended study of 23
stocks on BME and 74 stocks on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) further conﬁrms this result
(Moro et al. 2009). We pool together the data from 23 stocks on the SZSE, and investigate the
PDFs of T , N and V for trade packages ended by the break of 1,5,10 days. Power-law tails
are observed in the PDFs of these variables. For a variable x which obeys a power-law tail
distribution, we suppose its PDF follows a formula

P (x) = cx−δ, x ≥ xmin.

(1)

We ﬁrst calculate the PDF of the execution time T . Note the PDF is diﬀerent for diﬀerent types
of investors, we present the results for institutions and individuals respectively. In Figures 1(a)
and 1(b), P (T ) of trade packages ended by the break of 1,5,10 days for both institutions and
individuals are plotted. The PDFs seem to have power-law tails, and we ﬁt them using a power-
law function presented in Equation (1). A rough estimation shows the exponent δ might smaller
than one. For a sequence of variable x = x1, · · · , xn restricted to a ﬁnite region [xmin, xmax], the
parameter c is

c =

where F is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the empirical data and FPL is the
CDF of the power-law ﬁt. The CDF of the power-law function in Equation (1) with parameter

To make the empirical PDF and the best power-law ﬁt as similar as possible, we determine the

standard error on δ, according to Clauset et al. (2009), is

As shown in Figure 1(a), P (T ) for institutions displays power-law tails covering a scaling
range over two orders of magnitude, and the exponent δT varies with diﬀerent break length. For
the break of one day, δT is estimated to be 0.3, while for the break longer than ﬁve days δT is
relatively constant and is around 0.8. In the ﬁgure, the power-law ﬁts with parameters listed in
Table 2 are also illustrated. For individuals, we observe similar results, and the estimated values
of δT are slightly larger than those for the institution, as depicted in Table 2.

We then calculate the PDF of the number of trades N . In Figures 1(c) and 1(d), we plot
P (N ) of trade packages ended by the break of 1,5,10 days for both institutions and individuals.

individuals, δN is 4.0 for the break of one day, and about 2.9 for the break longer than ﬁve days.
The power-law ﬁts are also illustrated in the ﬁgure, and the estimated values of δN are depicted
in Table 2.

We also calculate the PDF of the total trading volume V , and similar power-law tails are
observed. In Figures 1(e) and 1(f), P (V ) of trade packages ended by the break of 1,5,10 days
for both institutions and individuals are plotted. For institutions, δV for the break of one day is
2.4, displaying a value very close to that for the break longer than ﬁve days, while for individuals
δV for the break of one day is 3.2 larger than 2.7 that for the break longer than ﬁve days. The
power-law ﬁts of P (V ) with parameters listed in Table 2 are also illustrated in the ﬁgure.

3.2. Scaling relations between variables characterizing trade packages

Empirical studies have revealed that there exist scaling relations between variables T , N and V

T ∼ V g1, N ∼ V g2, T ∼ N g3.

(10)

It is found g1 ≃ 2, g2 ≃ 1, and g3 ≃ 1.7 for BME and LSE markets (Moro et al. 2009). We
also ﬁnd that T , N and V of the trade packages for SZSE are related through scaling relations,
but with diﬀerent values of g1, g2 and g3, primarily due to the small value of the exponent δT .
Since the exponents δT , δN and δV diﬀer for the two types of investors, we calculate the scaling
relations for institutions and individuals respectively.

We study the scaling relation between T and V by calculating the mean conditional execution
time hT |V i conditioned on the total trading volume V . We arrange the entire T sequences in
ascending order, and partition it to 20 bins with equal size. We calculate hT |V i conditioned on a
bin of V to get better statistics. In Figure 2(a), hT |V i for trade packages of institutions ended by
the break of one day is plotted. For large scales of V , one observes a scaling relation between T
and V , and g1 is estimated to be 0.18. This is consistent with the previous result that P (V ) obeys

the same method, and obtain g2 = 0.74 and g3 = 0.18 as illustrated in Figures 2(b) and 2(c).
For trade packages of individuals ended by the break of one day, we obtain g1 = 0.13, g2 = 0.72
and g3 = 0.16, slightly smaller than those for institutions, as shown in Figures 2(d), 2(e) and
2(f). Similar results are observed for trade packages of both institutions and individuals ended
by the break longer than ﬁve days. According to the scaling relations in Equation (10), one can
infer the relation that g1 = g2g3. The estimated values of g1, g2 and g3 depicted in Table 2 prove
the inferred relation between them.

4. Trading proﬁle

We further consider the question of how the individual transactions inside trade packages are
executed as a function of the time t of a day, which is called trading proﬁle. We are mainly
concerned about the trade packages ﬁnished within one day, i.e., packages ended by the break of
one day, and the time t is normalized by the time of a trading day D = 14400 seconds. Denote
vi as the trading volume of transaction i inside trade packages, we calculate the mean volume of
each transaction hv(t)i traded at normalized time t/D. To make the trading volumes of diﬀerent
stocks comparable, vi of a particular stock is normalized by its mean value.

In Figures 3(a) and 3(b), the mean trading volume hv(t)i of individual transactions inside
trade packages is plotted as a function of the normalized time t/D for institutions and individ-

uals respectively. Since the mean trading volume may diﬀer for the transactions with diﬀerent
aggressiveness, we calculate hv(t)i of the transactions executed as market orders (ﬁlled black
circles) and limit orders (empty black circles). One observes that institutions prefer to place
large market orders close to the opening time, while individuals are more likely to place large
market orders close to the closing time of the day. Moreover, hv(t)i of market orders is much
more signiﬁcant than that of limit orders, which indicates that the trade packages are accom-
plished mostly by market orders. Therefore, hv(t)i of the total market orders and limit orders
(black squares) shows a similar proﬁle to that of the market orders. The mean trading volume
of the transactions concurrently traded with trade packages (red diamonds) also has a similar
proﬁle, slightly larger than that for the total market orders and limit orders, diﬀerent from that
observed in BME and LSE markets (Clauset et al. 2009). These results are quite robust for trade
packages of both institutions and individuals.

To complectly understand the trading proﬁle, we further consider the number of transactions
executed at time t. We calculate the probability distribution P (t) of the transaction time t,
deﬁned as the proportion between number of transactions traded at time t to the total number
of transactions inside trade packages. As shown in Figure 3(c), P (t) for institutions is relatively
small close to the opening time of the day. It may be explained by the phenomena that the
mean volume of individual transactions is signiﬁcant large then, and only a few numbers of
transactions could accomplish the purchase or sale of large amounts of shares. There is a midday
break during the lunch time in Chinese stock market, and the surge of P (t) soon after midday
break may be caused by the entrance of many institutions who start trade packages in the
afternoon. An increase of P (t) is also observed close to the closing time of the day, this may
because that all the trade packages within one day should be accomplished at that time. The
probability distribution P (t) for individuals shows a similar proﬁle to that for institutions. We
also measure the probability distribution of the initial and ﬁnal time of trade packages. As
shown in Figures 3(e) and 3(f), for both institutions and individuals a signiﬁcant fraction of
trade packages are started at the opening time and ﬁnished at the closing time. Moreover, there
are quite a number of trade packages start after the midday break, and this may explain the
surge of P (t) soon after the midday break.

We ﬁnally investigate the total trading volume of individual transactions inside trade packages
traded at time t, i.e., the product of the mean volume of individual transactions and the number

trade packages is plotted with respect to time t for institutions and individuals respectively.

The price impact is a very important issue in ﬁnancial studies, and a large number of studies
have focused attention on this topic. In this section, we ﬁrst consider the price impact of trade
packages, generally measured as the diﬀerence between the price prior and after the trade pack-

age (Chan and Lakonishok 1995, Gallagher and Looi 2006). For a trade package accomplished
between time t and t + T , we follow the work by Moro et al. (2009), and deﬁne the price impact
as the diﬀerence between the logarithmic price of the ﬁrst and last transaction of the trade
package

r = ln p(t + T ) − ln p(t).

(11)

The scaled price impact is obtained by taking into account the normalization condition and the
sign of the trade package

R = sr/h|r|i,

(12)

where s = +1 (−1) represents the package with mostly buy (sell) trades, and r is normalized by
the mean absolute return h|r|i of the relevant stock.

5.1.1. R vs T

We investigate the dependence of the scaled price impact R on the execution time T . We only
consider the trade packages ﬁnished within one day, since the price impact persists over more than
one day not only capture the information contained in the trade package but also be aﬀected by
the nonsuccessive trades overnight. In Figures 4(a) and 4(b), the mean conditional scaled price
impact hR|T i is plotted as a function of the execution time T for institutions and individuals
respectively. A trade package can be accomplished with diﬀerent component of market orders
and limit orders. To identify it, we calculate the variable Fm deﬁned as the fraction of volumes
done through market orders within trade packages. The mean conditional price impact hR|T i
for trade packages with large and small fraction of market orders, i.e., Fm > 0.8 and Fm < 0.2,
are represented separately in the ﬁgure.

Despite of strong ﬂuctuation in the conditional price impact, the mean conditional price impact
hR|T i with Fm > 0.8 is mostly positive over the whole range of T for both institutions and
individuals. This indicates that the trade package has a nonnegligible price impact over the
whole range of execution time up to one day. The cumulative eﬀect of a sequence of mostly
buyer-initiated trades is more like to raise the price, while the cumulative eﬀect of a sequence of
mostly seller-initiated trades is more likely to reduce the price. Moreover, hR|T i with Fm < 0.2 is
mostly negative, and this implies that the price impact of a trade packages is not dominated by
the sign of the most trades when there is a low fraction of market orders. We further perform the
analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test if the means of the conditional price impact for diﬀerent
T are equal. For institutions, we obtain a p-value 0.919 for trade packages with Fm > 0.8, and
a p-value 0.787 for trade packages with Fm < 0.2. Similar large p-values are observed for trade
packages of individuals, which indicates that hR|T i does not have much diﬀerence for various T .
No clear tendency of hR|T i is observed in our study.

5.1.2. R vs V

We then investigate the dependence of the scaled price impact R on the total trading volume
V . The mean conditional scaled price impact hR|V i with Fm > 0.8 and Fm < 0.2 for both
institutions and individuals are plotted as a function of the total trading volume V in Figures 4(c)
and 4(d). For both institutions and individuals, hR|V i is mostly positive for trade packages with
Fm > 0.8, while mostly negative for trade packages with Fm < 0.2. This further conﬁrms our
previous ﬁnding that the cumulative impact of a trade package is dominated by the sign of the
most trades when there is a large fraction of market orders. We also use the ANOVA to compare
the means of the conditional price impact for diﬀerent V , and ﬁnd very small p-values for trade
packages of both institutions and individuals with Fm > 0.8 and Fm < 0.2, indicating the means

diﬀer with the variation of V . Similar to the price-volume relation revealed in many empirical
studies, we assume the absolute hR|V i for large V follows a power law

|hR|V i| = AV γ.

(13)

The power-law ﬁts with estimated parameters A and γ listed in Table 3 are illustrated in Fig-
ures 4(c) and 4(d). For trade packages with Fm > 0.8, γ is about 0.447 for institutions, and
0.295 for individuals. The exponent γ for trade packages with Fm < 0.2 is slightly larger. The
power-law increase of hR|V i at large scales of V may correspond to the purchase or sale of large
amounts of shares with the motive to adjust share inventory. However, hR|V i for trade packages
of institutions with Fm > 0.8 does not increase monotonously with the increase of V . The vari-
able hR|V i shows a decreasing tendency with increasing V when V is small. This indicates that
small trading volumes may also cause large price changes, and it may refer to the purchase or
sale of small amounts of shares for the purpose of stock price adjustment.

5.2.

Instantaneous price impact of transactions inside trade packages

We have shown the price impact of the entire trade packages, and then we investigate the
price impact of individual transactions inside trade packages. Given a transaction i inside trade
package traded at time t, p(t−) is the price before this transaction, and p(t) is the resultant price

immediate after it. The price impact of the transaction i inside trade package is deﬁned as

ri = ln p(t) − ln p(t−),

(14)

which is the instantaneous change of logarithmic price contributed from the transaction i. To
make the price impact comparable over diﬀerent stocks, the price impact of a particular stock
is normalized by its mean absolute value

Ri = siri/h|ri|i,

(15)

where si = +1 for buy trades and si = −1 for sell trades.

We measure the mean conditional scaled price impact hRi|ti of individual transactions con-
ditioned on the time t. In Figures 5(a) and 5(b), hRi|ti is plotted as a function of the time t
for institutions and individuals respectively. The mean conditional scaled price impact of the
transactions executed as market orders and limit orders are represented by black circles and red
squares in the ﬁgure. For market orders, hRi|ti displays a concave U-shaped proﬁle. Though the
error bar is quite large, hRi|ti for market orders is mostly positive. For limit orders, hRi|ti is
mostly negative, and displays an inverted U-shaped proﬁle. The sign of hRi|ti indicates that the
direction of the price change is driven by the market order. In other words, the buyer-initiated
trades raise the price, and the seller-initiated trades reduce the price. Moreover, the U-shaped
and inverted U-shaped proﬁles imply that the price impact close to the opening and closing time
is larger than the price impact during the remainder of the day. We also investigate the price
impact of the transactions concurrently traded with those transactions inside trade packages

Rcon = sircon/h|ri|i,

(16)

where si and h|ri|i are the sign and the mean absolute return of transactions inside trade pack-
ages, and rcon represents the price return caused by the transactions concurrently traded with
those transactions inside trade packages. The mean conditional scaled price impact hRcon|ti (blue
diamonds) ﬂuctuates around zero, which indicates that the price impact of market trades is not
merely driven by the consecutive trades by large investors.

5.2.2. Ri vs v

To investigate the dependence of the price impact of transactions inside trade packages on their
trading volumes, we calculate the mean conditional scaled rice impact hRi|vi. In Figures 5(c) and
5(d), hRi|vi is plotted for institutions and individuals respectively. One observes that hRi|vi for
transactions executed as market orders is mostly positive while that for transactions executed as

limit orders is mostly negative. This further conﬁrms the result that the market order determines
the direction of the price change as observed in hRi|ti. Similar to hR|V i for trade packages, the
absolute hRi|vi of transactions inside trade packages follows a power law

|hRi|vi| = Bvk,

(17)

when v is large enough v > 103. The estimated parameters B and k for the power-law ﬁt of hRi|vi
are listed in Table 4. The exponent k for transactions executed as market orders is larger than
that for transactions executed as limit orders, which indicates that for the isolated transactions
inside trade packages the price impact is remarkably aﬀected by the market order. However, the
cumulative impact of trade packages with small fraction of market orders is comparable with the
cumulative impact of trade packages with large fraction of market orders. In fact, the exponent
γ of hR|V i for packages with Fm < 0.2 is slightly larger than that for packages with Fm > 0.8.
This may because the investors use diﬀerent strategies for the accomplishment of trade packages.
Like a sequence of mostly buyer-initiated trades, a sequence of sales mostly executed as limit
orders can also raise the price, aﬀected by the buyer-initiated trades on the opposite sides.

5.3. Temporary price impact of transactions inside trade packages

5.3.1.

Impact of trading volumes on current and following price returns

Numerous studies have focused on the inﬂuence of trading volumes or volume imbalances
on price returns (Wood et al. 1985, Karpoﬀ 1987, Gallant et al. 1992, Saatcioglu and Starks
1998, Lillo et al. 2003, Plerou et al. 2002, Chordia and Subrahmanyam 2004). We analyze the
temporary impact of transactions inside trade packages in relation to their trading volumes.
Suppose r(t) = ln p(t) − ln p(t − 1) is the price return at time t, v(t) is the trading volume of a
transaction inside trade package traded at time t. The returns of a certain stock are normalized
by its standard deviation. To explain the inﬂuence of the trading volume at time t on the price
return at later time t + i, we estimate a regression of the following form

R(t + i) = β∗

0 + βis ln v(t) + ǫ(t),

(18)

where s is the sign of the transaction. We measure the impact of the trading volumes v(t) within
trade package on the current price return i = 0 and the following price returns i = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25
seconds. It has been empirically veriﬁed that the price return has a power-law dependence on the
trading volume (Hasbrouck 1991, Plerou et al. 2002, Chordia and Subrahmanyam 2004, Zhou
2011), also conﬁrmed in the measure of hRi|vi. The ﬁrst-order approximation of the logarithmic
return is assumed, and a linear regression of the return against logarithmic trading volume is
used to approximate their power-law relations.

Table 5 reports the estimated coeﬃcients of regressions using the records of transactions
inside trade packages executed as market orders from institutions. Positive coeﬃcient β0sec is
observed in all the 23 stocks, which further conﬁrms the ﬁnding that the sign of price return is
determined by the sign of the market order as revealed in the measure of hRi|ti. The relevant
t-statistics are also depicted in Table 5. The impact of trading volume on the current price return
is signiﬁcant for most of stocks except for stocks 000009, 000012, 000429, 000550. This indicates
that the instantaneous impact of the trading volumes executed as market orders is positive and
signiﬁcant. We ﬁnd the price tends to reverse soon after the transaction inside trade package,
showing negative βi with i > 0. This reminds us of the signiﬁcant price reversal after large
price changes (Zawadowski et al. 2004, Mu et al. 2010). The magnitudes of βi with i > 0 are
signiﬁcantly smaller than β0sec, and decrease with the increase of time lag i. Coeﬃcient β5sec
is negative and signiﬁcant for more than half of the stocks, and negative and signiﬁcant β10sec
is also observed in almost half of the stocks. This implies that for almost half of the stocks
the trading volumes of transactions inside trade packages have temporary negative eﬀects on
price returns for at least 5 − 10 seconds. With rare exceptions, the stocks have nonsigniﬁcant
coeﬃcients βi for large time lag i ≥ 15 seconds. For the trading volumes of transactions inside
trade packages executed as limit orders, a temporary impact is also observed. Negative β0sec

is obtained for most of the stocks, indicating the price return has a sign opposite to that of
the trading volume. Positive β5sec and β10sec further conﬁrm the price reversal soon after the
transaction inside trade package.

The temporary impact of transactions inside trade packages for individuals persists over a
horizon longer than the impact time for institutions. In Table 6, the estimated coeﬃcients βi with
i = 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 seconds using the records of transactions inside trade packages executed as
market orders from individuals are depicted. Coeﬃcient β0sec is positive and signiﬁcant for all
the 23 stocks, which further veriﬁes the strong impact of the trading volume on the current price
return. Moreover, β0sec is larger than the magnitudes of coeﬃcients βi with i > 0. Coeﬃcients
βi with time lag 5 ≤ i ≤ 20 seconds are negative and signiﬁcant for most stocks, and β25sec is
signiﬁcant for almost half of the stocks. This implies that the trading volumes of transactions
inside trade packages for individuals have temporary negative eﬀects on price returns for about
20 − 25 seconds. Similar to the trading volumes executed as limited orders from institutions, the
trading volumes executed as limited orders from individuals have a negative impact on current
price returns, and the following price returns tend to reverse soon.

5.3.2. Modeling price returns

It has been shown that the trading volumes of transactions inside trade packages have a
signiﬁcant impact on price returns. We model the price return R(t) taking into account both
the autoregressive components of previous returns R(t − j) and the previous trading volumes
v(t − i) within trade packages. The regression from is

where ln v(t − i) = 0 when there is no transaction inside trade package executed at time t − i. We
do not separately consider the eﬀects of trading volumes of the transactions concurrently traded
with those transactions inside trade packages, but contribute their impact to the corresponding
price returns. The coeﬃcient βi reﬂects the response of the return R(t) to the trading volume
of transaction inside trade package executed i seconds before time t. We have veriﬁed that the
trading volumes of transactions inside trade packages have a temporary impact on price returns
for less than half a minute, and therefore we restrict I = 25 seconds. The parameter J is also
set to J = 25 seconds to simplify the regression.

We report the estimated coeﬃcients βi by ﬁtting Equation (19) with i = 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25
seconds using the records of transactions inside trade packages executed as market orders from
institutions in Table 7. According to the R2 in the last column, the ﬁtted model could explain
considerable portion, generally has R2 ≥ 20%, of the variance in price returns. For i = 0, positive
and signiﬁcant coeﬃcient β0sec is observed in all the 23 stocks, displaying values signiﬁcantly
larger than the magnitudes of βi with i > 0. This further conﬁrms that the trading volumes of
transactions inside trade packages executed as market orders have a strong impact on current
price returns. However, the negative relation between the price return and the trading volume
executed 5 seconds before is weakened, not as signiﬁcant as that observed in the simple regression
of Equation (18). After taking into account the autoregressive components, only ﬁve stocks have
signiﬁcant coeﬃcients β5sec, and four of them are negative. To further increase the time lag i,
the number of stocks which have signiﬁcant coeﬃcients βi is even smaller. The shortening of
the impact time may because the price return can be partially explained by the autoregressive
components of previous returns.

We also obtain the coeﬃcients βi by estimating Equation (19) using the records of transactions
inside trade packages executed as market orders from individuals as depicted in Table 8. The
R2 for individuals is generally smaller than that for institutions, but still has values ≥ 10% for

most stocks. Coeﬃcient β0sec for individuals is positive and signiﬁcant for all the stocks, but
approximately one order of magnitude smaller than β0sec for institutions. This implies that the
positive impact of trading volumes on current price returns for individuals is not as strong as
that for institutions. More than half of the stocks have negative and signiﬁcant coeﬃcients βi
for i ≤ 25 seconds. This indicates that for more than half of the stocks the trading volumes of
transactions inside trade packages have a temporary negative impact for at least 25 seconds. In
comparison with the trading volumes for institutions, the trading volumes for individuals have
a negative price impact over a relatively longer horizon even after considering the autoregressive
components of previous returns.

6. Summary

This paper studies the characteristic properties of trade packages made by both institutional
and individual investors trading on Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The sequence of transactions are
grouped into packages with mostly buy or sell trades separated by the break of 1, 5, 10 days. The
probability distributions of the variables, i.e., the execution time T , the number of trades N and
the total trading volume V , characterizing trade packages show power-law tails, and a power-law
ﬁtting method based on KS statistic is adopted to estimate their exponents. The exponent of
the execution time is smaller than 1.0, and the exponent of the trades number is around 3.0
close to that of the total trading volume. The exponents vary with the break length, and tend
to be constant for the break length longer than 5 days. Moreover, the exponents for individuals
are slightly larger than those for institutions. The scaling relations between these variables are
also detected. All the scaling exponents show values smaller than 1.0, diﬀerent from those found
by Vaglica et al. (2008) and Moro et al. (2009).

We have also studied the trading proﬁle of the trade packages accomplished within one day. By
investigating the mean trading volume of the individual transactions inside trade packages, we
ﬁnd that large amounts of shares are more likely to be executed close to the opening and closing

time respectively for institutions and individuals. The probability distribution of the transaction
time shows that both institutional and individual investors trade more frequently after the
midday break, and it displays a maximum at the closing time of the day. This phenomena might
be explained by their preferences on the initial and ﬁnal time of trade packages. The proﬁle of the
total trading volume further implies that institutions may be more informed than individuals.
The price impact of trade packages and its relations with the execution time T and the
total trading volume V are analyzed respectively. We ﬁnd the price impact remains nonzero
over the whole period of execution time. The price impact has an empirical power-law relation
with the total trading volume. Furthermore, the instantaneous price impact of the transactions
inside trade packages is investigated, and transactions close to the opening and closing time of
the day have a stronger impact than those during the remainder of the day. Similar to trade
packages, the transactions inside trade packages also show a power-law dependence on their
corresponding volumes. To study the temporary impact of transactions inside trade packages, we
regress the price return against its current and previous trading volumes within trade packages,
and further model the price return taking into account both the autoregressive components
of previous returns and the current and previous trading volumes within trade packages. The
regression results show that the trading volumes of the transactions inside trade packages have
a strong positive impact on current price returns, while the reversals of the following prices are
less strong and persist over only a few seconds. This may help explain the permanent impact
of isolated transactions revealed in the empirical study of block trades (Keim and Madhavan
1996, Gregoriou 2008, Kraus and Stoll 1972, Gemmill 1996). In addition, the impact of trading
volumes on current price returns for institutions is stronger than that for individuals, and the
price reversal for individuals persists over a horizon relatively longer than that for institutions.
Though the transactions inside trade packages have a temporary impact persisting over only
a few seconds, the cumulative impact of trade packages is signiﬁcant over the whole period of
execution time (Gemmill 1996).
