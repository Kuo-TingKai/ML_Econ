Absolute Return Volatility 

The  use  of  absolute  return  volatility  has  many  modelling  benefits  says  John 
Cotter.  An illustration is given for the market risk measure, minimum capital 
requirements.   
 
Volatility  modelling  is  a  key  issue  for  the  finance  industry  from  an  academic  and 

practitioner  perspective.   This  is  understandable given  the importance  that  volatility 

plays  in  risk  management  and  the  development  of  accurate  risk  measures.    To 

illustrate,  successful  market  risk  management  requires  the  use  of  accurate  risk 

measures  such  as  minimum  capital  requirements.    These  risk  measures  are 
underpinned the input of volatility estimates.1   
 

An important key question thus arises: How do we obtain accurate volatility measures 

that can be used in market risk management?  This paper addresses this by exploring 

the  asymptotic  and  finite  sample  properties  of  absolute  return  volatility.    Absolute 

return  volatility  is  obtained  by  aggregating  high  frequency  absolute  returns  into 

relatively  low  frequency,  for  example,  daily  volatility  estimates.    The  use  of  these 

measures  is  illustrated  by  obtaining  the  commonly  used  market  risk  measure, 

minimum  capital  requirements.    We  advocate  the  use  of  absolute  return  volatility 

gives desirable time series properties and provides accurate measures of volatility.    

 

We  begin  by  noting  that  standard  risk  management  practices  postulate  that  market 

returns  belong  to  a  gaussian  distribution.    As  we  know  this  is  not  so  and  leads  to 

inadequate  risk  measurement.    For  example,  commonly  cited  deviations  from 

normality in financial time series are the existence of fat-tails and of serial correlation 
in the volatility series, leading to a bias in minimum capital requirement estimates.2  If 
however, volatility can be adequately modelled, the risk manager can filter out these 

properties  from  the  returns  series  leading  to  a  gaussian  series.    These  standardised 

gaussian  returns  allow  the  risk  manager  to  provide  conservative  and  accurate  risk 

measures.   

                                                 
1  Minimum  capital  requirements  represent  reserves  that  are  used  to  protect  financial  firms  against 
losses arising from the volatility of their holdings (see Cotter, 2004; for a discussion).   
2 A key focus of many studies in market risk measurement is to explore alternative volatility processes.  
For instance, a number of conditional based approaches using Generalised Autoregressive Conditional 
Heteroskedastic (GARCH) and related univariate or multivariate process have been advocated (Brooks 
et al, 2002).  In addition, unconditional approaches that rely on separate risk measures for the upside 
and downside of a distribution have been supported such as the use of Extreme Value Theory (Longin 
1996, 2000).

Absolute returns, overlooked in comparison to the use of squared returns, have many 

advantages in modelling volatility.  First, absolute returns are robust in the presence 

of  extreme  or  tail  movements (Davidian  and Carroll,  1987).    Tail  returns  with their 

noted fat-tailed characteristic in  financial  time  series  are of  particular  importance  in 

market  risk  management  and in associated  risk measures  such  as  Value at Risk and 

minimum  capital  requirements.    Second,  accurate  measures  of  unobservable  latent 

volatility  are  obtained  from  absolute  return  volatility  asymptotically  through  the 

theoretical  framework  of  realised  power  variation.    Moreover,  absolute  return 

volatility gives desirable finite sample properties that are applicable in practice for the 

risk  manager.    In  particular,  the  properties  match  those  found  in  market  returns 

including serial correlation and by standardising the return series we eliminate these 
features.3    Also,  absolute  return  volatility  measurement  uses  data  with  the  highest 
frequency  and  this  is  beneficial  in  getting  more  precise  estimates  of  risk  measures 

(Merton, 1980). 

 

The theoretical framework of realised power variation that underpins absolute return 

volatility is now outlined.  This is followed by an illustration of the use of absolute 

return volatility in the calculation of minimum capital requirements for long and short 

trading positions on the FTSE100 futures contract. 
 
Realised power variation: 
One  recent  major  innovation  in  the  volatility  literature  has  been  the  employment  of 

realised  power  variation  where  realised  volatility  converges  in  probability  to 

integrated volatility.  Accurate model free volatility estimates are thus obtained.  This 

theory relied on in the continuous time literature results in gaussian return innovations 

being a standard assumption of the pricing models presented.   

 

The theoretical developments have evolved in conjunction with vast improvements in 

high  frequency  data  allowing  the  continuous  time  framework  to  be  realistically 

examined  in  a  discrete  context.    The  price  process  is  assumed  to  follow  Brownian 

                                                 
3 Also absolute return modelling has a number of other attractive features.  For instance, absolute return 
modelling is more reliable than squared returns for the non-existence of a fourth moment commonly 
associated with financial returns (Mikosch and Starcia, 2000).

motion  and  allows  for  accurate  estimates  of  unobservable  volatility  at  the  limit.  

Discrete approximations of the price process using high frequency data have rm, t = pt - 
pt-1/m as the continuously compounded returns with m evenly spaced observations per 
day.  Brownian motion is generalized to allow the volatility to be random but serially 

dependent  exhibiting  the  stylized  finding  for  financial  return  series  of  volatility 
clustering with fat-tailed unconditional distributions.4   
 

Volatility  of  this  price  process as  measured  by  integrated  volatility  is  unobservable.  

However,  realised  power  variation  that  incorporates  realised  absolute  variation, 

namely  the  sum  of  absolute  realisations,  (cid:1)|rm|,  of  a  process  captured  at  very  fine 

intervals  equate  with  integrated  volatility.      This  theory  of  realised  power  variation 

given in Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2003) and Barndorff-Nielsen et al (2003) 
extends the framework of quadratic variation presented for different square powers.5  
Thus  for  returns  that  are  white  noise  and  s2
t  with  continuous  sample  paths,  the 
limiting  difference  between  the  unobserved  volatility  estimate  and  the  realised 

observed absolute variation is zero.   

 

Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard (2003) and Barndorff-Nielsen et al (2003) show that 
when the framework is for limiting intervals with m ﬁ ¥, and with power variations, 
0.5 > n < 3, realised power variation converges in probability to integrated volatility.

Implying for m sampling frequency, the realized absolute variation is consistent with 

integrated  volatility.    Asymptotically  the  returns  process  scaled  by  realised  power 

variation is normally distributed, N (0, 1).     

 

                                                 
4  A  number  of  semi-martingales  can  be  utilised,  and  volatility  modelling  in  this  way  allow  for  any 
number  of  characteristics  documented  for  financial  time  series  such  as  long  memory  and  non-
stationarity.   
5  The  use  of  squared returns relying  on  quadratic  variation  has  become a tour  de force  in the  recent 
volatility literature with many studies completed.  A flavour of the use of these related measures and a 
synopsis of the prevailing literature is in Andersen et al (2003).  Similar to realised power variation the 
theory  of  quadratic  variation  implies  that  after  assuming  sample  returns  are  white  noise  and  s2
t  has 
continuous  sample  paths,  the  limiting  difference  between  the  unobserved  volatility  estimate  and  the 
observed realizations of the squared returns process is zero (Karatzas and Shreve (1991)).

Notwithstanding  the  derivation  of  the  limiting  distribution,  our  interest  in  the 

modelling process for risk measurement is in terms of its ability to capture financial 

return  finite-sample  properties.    Thus,  the  finite-sample  properties  and  their 

consequences  especially  for  relatively  small  samples  that  match  the  investment 

horizon of risk managers need exploration. 

 

The  practical  implementation  of  the  theory  simplifies  into  developing  volatility 

estimators using aggregated absolute returns, (cid:1)|rm| and its’ variants for any day t with 

m intraday intervals:

For  n  =  2,  this  represents  the  quadratic  variation  result  where  squared  returns  are 

equated to integrated volatility.    

 

The  number  of  intervals  chosen  is  asset  dependent  impacted  on  by  such  factors  as 

levels of trading activity and of inherent volatility.  However, there is a trade-off as m 

increases the precision of realized power variation increases but microstructure effects 

such as bid-ask bounce increasing at finer intervals can impair the modelling process.  

This study follows the standard interval choice of 5-minute intervals throughout the 

trading day.   

 

As  well  as  directly  comparing  different  volatility  series  using  absolute  and  squared 

reaslisations the study examines the ability of the respective measures to filter out the 

time-varying  dynamics  associated  with  asset  prices.    Daily  Returns,  rt,  obtained  by 
aggregating  the  high  frequency  intraday  returns,  rm,  t,  are  rescaled  by  the  respective 
daily volatility series: 
 zt = rt/st 

 
where  the  standardised  returns  series,  zt,  are  obtained  from  scaling  returns,  rt,  with 
each of the volatility proxies, st.

Characteristics of volatility series: 
Turning  to  the  application  of  this  method  we  take  high  frequency  prices  for  the 

FTSE100 futures contract traded on LIFFE, for a relatively short time frame between 

January 1, 1999 through June 30, 2000 using the most actively traded delivery month 

data  from  a  volume  crossover  procedure.    For  each  5-minute  interval  log  closing 

prices  are  first  differenced  to  obtain  each  period’s  return.    The  full  trading  day  is 

between  08.35  and  17.35  entailing  107  5-minute  intervals.    All  non-trading  periods 

and holidays are removed resulting in 375 full trading days for analysis. 

 

Daily  returns  and  daily  volatility  series  are  generated  from  aggregating  intraday 

values such as absolute returns and power variations across the trading day.  In order 

to  examine  the  unconditional  distributional  properties  of  the  daily  return  and  risk 

measures  summary  statistics  are  estimated  detailing  four  distributional  moments 

presented in table 1.  A subset of findings for power coefficients between 0.5 and 1.5 
are given.6    Also, some distributional plots for the returns series, and the volatility 
and  standardised  returns  series  with  the  most  attractive  distributional  characteristics 

are given in figure 1.  The latter series are of particular interest as we are determining 

the  extent  to  which  we  can  filter  out  the  non-gaussian  features  of  financial  returns 

using the two sets of volatility series. 

INSERT TABLE 1 HERE

The  usual  finding  for  the  unconditional  distribution  of  financial  returns  is  evident, 

namely  they  are  leptokurtotic  implying  too  many  realisations  bunching  around  the 

peak  and  tails  of  the  distribution  relative  to  gaussianity.    In  particular  the 

distributional  plots  indicate  the  fat-tailed  characteristic  of  financial  returns  with  too 

many large extreme observations relative to a normal distribution.     

 

In table 1 panel B absolute return volatility and squared return volatility are analysed.  

Absolute  return  volatility  clearly  dominates  squared  return  volatility  in  terms  of 

desirable time series properties.  Whilst the coefficients for third and fourth moments 

of  the  volatility  series  with  the  most  attractive  distributional  characteristics  appear 
                                                 
6 The main distributional inferences are contained within the results in table 1 and figures 1 and 2.  
Further results for different power coefficients are available on request.

similar, squared returns volatility is more prone to outliers as shown by a very long 

right tail in figure 1.  In general absolute return volatility is more closely associated to 
a normal distribution than squared return volatility at all power transformations.7   
 

The  standardised  returns  series,  rescaling  daily  returns  by  the  different  volatility  is 

presented  in  panel  C.    We  are  interested  in  determining  whether  we  can  obtain 

gaussian standardised returns and also identify the volatility processes that allow us to 

achieve this aim.  We find a positive outcome to this endeavour if we standardise by 

absolute  volatility  only.    Thus  unconditionally,  returns  rescaled  by  absolute  return 

volatility clearly dominate their squared return counterparts in closely approximating 

gaussian features.  A number of the standardised returns series rescaled by absolute 

returns exhibit no excess skewness and kurtosis and others show a vast improvement 

in  their  characteristics.    In  fact,  the  fat-tailed  property  disappears  to  the  extent  that 

platykurtotic  features  exist.    These  rescaled  series  can  now  give  appropriate  risk 

measures  that  can  be  extended  further,  by  for  example,  incorporating  the  gaussian 

square root of time multiplier.      

 

In  contrast,  the  standardised  returns  rescaled  by  squared  return  volatility,  with  the 
2]  0.50  representing  realised  standard  deviation,  still  exhibit 
exception  of  [zt]  =  [rt]/[rt
strong  excess  skewness  and  kurtosis.    Interestingly  this  squared  return  measure, 

realised  standard  deviation,  is  equivalent  to  absolute  return  volatility,  |rt|,  and  is 
equated  to  unobservable  integrated  volatility  from  the  theory  of  realised  power 

variation.   

 

Other squared return volatility series are unable to capture the dynamics of the returns 

series adequately.  For instance, the much-used realised variance is unable to remove 

the  excess  kurtosis  of  the  FTSE100  returns  series.    Thus  for  relatively  small  finite 

samples  it  is  clear  that  whilst  a  spectrum  of  standardised  returns  using  variants  of 

absolute  returns  allow  the  risk  manager  to  present  conservative  and  accurate  risk 

measures that adequately model the time-varying dynamics of asset returns this is not 

the case for their squared return counterparts. 

                                                 
7  Logarithmic  transformations  are  also  analysed  and  confirm  these  findings.    Results  available  on

The  theory  of  realised  power  variation  asymptotically  allows  the  conditional 

distribution  of  volatility  to  be  random  but  serially  dependent  and  to  exhibit  the 

stylized finding for financial data of volatility clustering.  Furthermore, the rescaling 

of  the returns  series  by  the  different volatility  proxies  should  produce  a white  noise 

series devoid of temporal dependence. 

 

To investigate the finite-sample properties of the use of absolute and squared return 

volatility  and 

their  power  variations 

to  match 

the  conditional  distribution 

characteristics of financial time series, figure 2 presents time series plots and sample 

autocorrelation  plots for the  returns  series,  volatility  and standardised  returns  series.  

The  overall  finite-sample  results  suggest  that  whilst  the  use  of  squared  realisations 

meets  only  some  of  the  criteria  to  adequately  model  financial  returns,  aggregated 

absolute realisations meet all criteria. 

 

INSERT FIGURE 2 HERE 

 

The  returns  series  exhibit  time-varying  dynamics  along  with  a  very  large  negative 

return  for  August  9,  1999  but  is  essentially  white  noise  with  no  significant 

dependence for 20 lags.   

   

As seen in table 1 both volatility series have unconditional distributions that are fat-

tailed and in figure 2 both conditional volatility series vary across time and volatility 

clusters are clearly evident for the absolute returns series.  Volatility clustering is less 

evident  in  the  squared  returns  volatility  series  as  a  large  outlier  dominates  it  on 

August 9 resulting in a single day’s volatility that is more than six times the size of 

the  next  largest  realisation.    Furthermore,  the  memory  of  the  volatility  series  using 

absolute realisations indicates strong serial correlation although no such dependence 

is  evident  from  using  squared  realisations,  as  these  are  also  white  noise.    Absolute 

return volatility thus matches the stylized features of financial time series. 

 
Minimum capital requirements: 
Risk  managers  are  interested  in  the  end  product  of  market  risk  measures  such  as 

minimum  capital  requirements.    The  methods  outlined  for  obtaining  volatility  and 

 

7 

standardised returns are now used in to calculate these market risk measures.  These 

capital  reserves  protect  investors  against  losses  arising  from  the  volatility  of  their 

holdings  and  thus  adequate  modeling  of  volatility  is  paramount  to  their  accurate 

measurement.   

 

Rather than using returns series that would entail an underestimation of risk measures 

assuming normality, the gaussian standardized returns are analysed.  This allows for 

conservative and consistent risk management estimates.  These are presented so as to 

cover  price  movements  at  various  probability  levels.    To  illustrate,  taking  a  long 

position and expressing the minimum capital requirement Lrmincap as a percentage of 
total investment that covers losses Lrloss at a certain probability:   

P L
[

loss

<

Lr

min

cap

]

= 0 95  

.

 

 

 

 

(3) 

In this case the capital deposit covers 95% of price movements and losses in excess of 

this would occur with a 5% frequency.  A one-day forecast of the capital required as a 

percentage  of  total  investment  uses  chosen  quantiles  of  the  standardized  returns 

updated with realized volatility measured by 

lt

= -1 exp(|

r |t

qz

)

      

 

 

 

 

(4) 

 

An illustration of minimum capital requirements for long and short trading positions 

at  common  confidence  levels  is  in  table  2.    For  instance,  to  cover  95%  of  all  price 

fluctuations in the FTSE100 contract requires a capital deposit of 2.81% of the total 

investment for a long position.  Thus this capital outlay would be insufficient for 5% 

of  the  outcomes  facing  the  investor  and  risk  management  strategies  would  be 

implemented with these capital costs in mind.

In conclusion, this paper advocates alternative measures of volatility using aggregated 

absolute returns and their variations.  The measures are underpinned by the theory of 

realised  power  variation  that  asymptotically  has  absolute  variation  converging  in 

probability  to  the  unobservable  integrated  volatility.    The  practical  use  of  these 

measures is illustrated in the context of minimum capital requirement estimates, a key 

market risk measure.

The  paper  shows  that  the  finite-sample  properties  of  absolute  return  volatility 

generally  dominate  squared  return  volatility.    In  particular,  rescaling  by  absolute 

return  volatility  results  in  gaussian  standardised  returns  for  a  spectrum  of  power 

variations.    Also,  volatility  clustering  and  strong  serial  correlation  are  evident  for 

absolute  return  volatility  series  matching  the  properties  of  financial  time  series.  

Moreover,  absolute  returns  are  more  robust  in  the  presence  of  extreme  returns  that 

result  in  fat-tails.    The  key  to  imposing  appropriate  risk  management  measures 

requires accurate modelling of volatility for different assets.  These accurate absolute 

return  volatility  measures  are  used  to  give  conservative  daily  minimum  capital 

requirements for the FTSE100 futures contract over a small trading period.

Notes: Density plots followed by q-q plots for the returns, volatility and standardised 
returns  series  are  presented.    The  volatility  and  standardised  returns  series  chosen 
relying on absolute and squared returns are based on those with the optimal skewness 
and  kurtosis  coefficients  vis-à-vis  normality.    Specifically,  the  volatility  series  are 
|rt|0.75  and  [rt
2]  and  the  standardised  returns  series  are  [zt]  =  [rt]/|rt|  and  [zt]  = 
[rt]/[rt

2]0.75.

Notes:  Time  series  plots  followed  by  ACF  plots  for  the  returns,  volatility  and 
standardised  returns  series  are  presented.    The  sample  autocorrelations  are  for  a 
displacement  of  20  days  from  a  full  sample  of  375  days  with  confidence  bands  of 
0.10.    The  volatility  and  standardised  returns  series  chosen  relying  on  absolute  and 
squared returns are based on those with the optimal skewness and kurtosis coefficients 
vis-à-vis  normality.    Specifically,  the  volatility  series  are  |rt|0.75  and  [rt
2]  and  the 
2]0.75.  The ACF plots for 
standardised returns series are [zt] = [rt]/|rt| and [zt] = [rt]/[rt
the standardised returns series examine squared variations.
