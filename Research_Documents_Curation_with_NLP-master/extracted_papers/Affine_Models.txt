Abstract. Aﬃne term structure models have gained signiﬁcant

attention in the ﬁnance literature, mainly due to their analytical

tractability and statistical ﬂexibility. The aim of this article is to

present both theoretical foundations as well as empirical aspects of

the aﬃne model class. Starting from the original one-factor short-

rate models of Vasiˇcek and Cox et al, we provide an overview of the

properties of regular aﬃne processes and explain their relationship

to aﬃne term structure models. Methods for securities pricing

and for parameter estimation are also discussed, demonstrating

how the analytical tractability of aﬃne models can be exploited

for practical purposes.

1. Definition

Notation 1. Throughout the article, h·, ·i denotes the standard scalar

product on RN .

Deﬁnition 1. Let rt be a short rate model speciﬁed as an aﬃne func-

tion of an N-dimensional Markov process Xt with state space D ⊆ RN :

rt = l + hλ, Xti,

(1)

for some (non time-dependent) constants l ∈ R and λ ∈ RN . This

is called an Aﬃne Term Structure Model (ATSM) if the zero-coupon

bond price has exponential aﬃne form, i.e.

P (t, T ) = Ehe−R T

t rsds(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)Xti = eG(t,T )+hH(t,T ),Xti,

(2)

where E denotes the expectation under a risk neutral probability mea-

sure.

2. Early Examples

Early well-known examples are the Vasiˇcek [14] and the Cox, In-

gersoll, Ross [5] (see eqf11-024 and eqf11-025) time-homogeneous one-

factor short rate models.

In (1), both models are characterized by

N = 1, l = 0 and λ = 1.

2.1. Vasiˇcek Model: Xt follows an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on

D = R,

dXt = (b + βXt)dt + σdWt,

b, β ∈ R,

σ ∈ R+,

AFFINE MODELS

3

where Wt is a standard Brownian motion. Under these model speciﬁ-

cations, bond prices can be explicitly calculated and the corresponding

coeﬃcients G and H in (2) are given by

H(t, T ) =

1 − eβ(T −t)

β

,

G(t, T ) =

σ2

2 Z T

t

H 2(s, T )ds + bZ T

t

H(s, T )ds,

provided that β 6= 0. (see also eqf11-024)

2.2. Cox-Ingersoll-Ross Model: Xt is deﬁned as the solution of the

following aﬃne diﬀusion process on D = R+, known as Feller square

root process,

dXt = (b + βXt)dt + σpXtdWt,

b, σ ∈ R+,

β ∈ R.

Like in the Vasiˇcek model, there is a closed-form solution for the bond

price. If σ 6= 0, G and H in (2) are then of the form:

G(t, T ) =

2b

σ2 ln 

2γe(γ−β)(T −t)/2

(γ − β)(eγ(T −t) − 1) + 2γ!,

H(t, T ) =

−2(eγ(T −t) − 1)

(γ − β)(eγ(T −t) − 1) + 2γ

,

where γ :=pβ2 + 2σ2. (see also eqf11-025)

Since the development of these ﬁrst one-dimensional term-structure

models, many multi-factor extensions have been considered with the

aim to provide more realistic models.

3. Regular Affine Processes

The generic method to construct ATSMs is to use regular aﬃne

processes. A concise mathematical foundation was provided by Duﬃe,

Filipovi´c and Schachermayer [7]. Henceforth, we ﬁx the state space

D = Rm

+ × RN −m, for some 0 ≤ m ≤ N.

Deﬁnition 2. A Markov process X is called regular aﬃne if its charac-

teristic function has exponential-aﬃne dependence on the initial state,

i.e. for t ∈ R+ and u ∈ iRN , there exist φ(t, u) ∈ C and ψ(t, u) ∈ CN ,

such that for all x ∈ D

E(cid:2)ehu,Xti(cid:12)(cid:12)X0 = x(cid:3) = eφ(t,u)+hψ(t,u),xi.

(3)

Moreover, the functions φ and ψ are continuous in t and ∂+

t φ(t, u)|t=0

and ∂+

t ψ(t, u)|t=0 exist and are continuous at u = 0.

Regular aﬃne processes have been deﬁned and completely charac-

terized in [7]. The main result is stated below.

Theorem 3. A regular aﬃne process is a Feller semimartingale with

inﬁnitesimal generator

∂xk∂xl

+ hB(x), ∇f (x)i − C(x)f (x)

(7)

(8)

where m, µi are Borel measures on D\{0} and χ : RN → RN some

bounded continuous truncation function with χ(ξ) = ξ in a neighbor-

hood of 0. Furthermore, φ and ψ in (3) solve the generalized Riccati

equations,

with

∂tφ(t, u) = F (ψ(t, u)), φ(0, u) = 0,

∂tψ(t, u) = R(ψ(t, u)), ψ(0, u) = u,

(9)

(10)

F (u) = hau, ui + hb, ui − c +ZD\{0}(cid:16)ehu,ξi − 1 − hu, χ(ξ)i(cid:17)m(dξ),
Ri(u) = hαiu, ui + hβi, ui − γi +ZD\{0}(cid:16)ehu,ξi − 1 − hu, χ(ξ)i(cid:17)µi(dξ),

for i ∈ {1, . . . , m},

Ri(u) = hβi, ui,

for i ∈ {m + 1, . . . , N}.

Conversely, for any choice of admissible parameters a, αi, b, βi, c, γi,

m, µi, there exists a unique regular aﬃne process with generator (4).

Remark 4. It is worth noting that the inﬁnitesimal generator of every

Feller process on RN has the form of the above integro-diﬀerential op-

erator (4) with some functions A, B, C and a kernel M. The speciﬁc

characteristic of regular aﬃne processes is that these functions are all

aﬃne, as described in (5) - (8).

Observe furthermore that by the deﬁnition of the inﬁnitesimal genera-

tor and the form of F and R, we have

d
dt

E(cid:2)ehu,Xti(cid:12)(cid:12)X0 = x(cid:3)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)t=0+

= (cid:0)∂+

= (F (u) + hR(u), xi) ehu,xi = Aehu,xi.

t φ(t, u)|t=0 + ∂+

t ψ(t, u)|t=0(cid:1) ehu,xi

This gives the link between the form of the operator A and the functions

F and R in the Riccati equations (9) and (10).

Remark 5. The above parameters satisfy certain admissibility condi-

tions guaranteeing the existence of the process in D. These parameter

restrictions can be found in Deﬁnition 2.6 and equations (2.23)-(2.24)

in [7]. We note that admissibility in particular means αi,kl = 0 for

i, k, l ≤ m unless k = l = i.

4. Systematic analysis

4.1. Regular aﬃne processes and ATSMs. Regular aﬃne pro-

cesses generically induce ATSMs. This relation is explicitly stated in

the subsequent argument. Under some technical conditions which are

AFFINE MODELS

speciﬁed in [7] chapter 11, we have for rt as deﬁned in (1),

(11)

where

Ehe−R t

0 rsdsehu,Xti(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)X0 = xi = eeφ(t,u)+h eψ(t,u),xi ,
∂teφ(t, u) = eF (eψ(t, u)),
∂teψ(t, u) = eR(eψ(t, u)),

with eF (u) = F (u) − l and eR(u) = R(u) − λ. Setting u = 0 in (11),
one immediately gets (2) with G(t, T ) = eφ(T − t, 0) and H(t, T ) =
eψ(T − t, 0).

4.2. Diﬀusion case. Conversely, for a class of diﬀusions

dXt = B(Xt)dt + σ(Xt)dWt

(12)

on D, Duﬃe and Kan [8] analyzed when (2) implies an aﬃne diﬀusion

matrix A = σσT

2 and an aﬃne drift B of form (5) and (6) respectively.

4.3. One dimensional nonnegative Markov process. For D =

R+, Filipovi´c [9] showed that (1) deﬁnes an ATSM if and only if Xt is

a regular aﬃne process.

4.4. Relation to Heath-Jarrow-Morton framework. Filipovi´c and

Teichmann [10] established a relation between the Heath-Jarrow-Morton

(HJM) framework (see eqf11-022) and ATSMs: Essentially, all generic

ﬁnite dimensional realizations1 of a HJM term structure model are

time-inhomogeneous ATSMs.

1For a precise deﬁnition see [10].

5. Canonical Representation

An ATSM stemming from a regular aﬃne diﬀusion process X on

Rm

+ × RN −m can be represented in diﬀerent ways by applying non-

singular aﬃne transformations to X.

Indeed, for every nonsingular

N × N-matrix K and κ ∈ RN , the transformation KX + κ modiﬁes

the particular form of (12) and the short rate process (1), while ob-

servable quantities (e.g.

the term structure or bond prices) remain

unchanged. In order to group those N-dimensional ATSMs generating

identical term structures, Dai and Singleton [6] found N +1 subfamilies

Am(N), where 0 ≤ m ≤ N is the number of state variables actually

appearing in the diﬀusion matrix (i.e. the dimension of the positive

half space). For each class, they speciﬁed a canonical representation

whose diﬀusion matrix σσT is of diagonal form with

(σσT (x))kk = 

xk,

1 +Pm

k ≤ m

,

i=1 λk,ixi k > m

where λk,i ∈ R. For N ≤ 3 the Dai-Singleton speciﬁcation comprises

all ATSMs generated by regular aﬃne diﬀusions on Rm

+ × RN −m. The

general situation N > 3 was analyzed by Cheridito, Filipovi´c and Kim-

mel [4].

6. Empirical Aspects

6.1. Pricing: The price of a claim with payoﬀ function f (Xt) is given

by the risk neutral expectation formula

π(t, x) = Ehe−R t

0 rsdsf (Xt)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)X0 = xi.

Suppose f can be expressed by

λ ∈ RN ,

(13)

then (11) implies

for some integrable function ef and some constant C ∈ RN . If, moreover

f (x) =ZRN

Ehe−R t

ehC+iλ,xief (λ)dλ,

ehC+iλ,Xtief (λ)dλ(cid:19)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)X0 = x(cid:21)
0 rsds(cid:18)ZRN

0 rsdsehC+iλ,Xti(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)X0 = xief (λ)dλ
Ehe−R t
= ZRN
eeφ(t,C+iλ)+h eψ(t,C+iλ),xief (λ)dλ.

Hence, the price π(t, x) can be computed via numerical integration,

since the integrands are in principle known. For instance, in the case

N = 1, the payoﬀ function of a European call (ex − ek)+, where x

corresponds to the log price of the underlying and k to the log strike

price, satisﬁes (13). In particular, we have the following integral rep-

resentation (see [11])

(ex − ek)+ =

1

2πZR

e(C+iλ)x

ek(1−C−iλ)

(C + iλ)(C + iλ − 1)

dλ.

Therefore, the previous formula to compute the price of the call π(t, x)

is applicable. An alternative approach leading to the same result can

be found in Carr and Madan [3].

6.2. Estimation: Statistical methods to estimate the parameters of

ATSMs have been based on maximum likelihood and generalized method

of moments.

Concerning maximum likelihood techniques, the conditional log den-

sities entering into the log likelihood function can in general be obtained

by inverse Fourier transformation. Since this procedure is computation-

ally costly, several approximations and limited-information estimation

strategies have been considered (e.g. [13]). Another possibility is to use

closed form expansions of the log likelihood function which are available

for general diﬀusions [1] and which have been applied to ATSMs. In

the case of Gaussian and Cox-Ingersoll-Ross models, one can forgo such

techniques, since the log densities are known in closed form (e.g [12]).

As conditional moments of the form E[X m

t X n

t−s] for m, n ≥ 0 can be

computed from the derivatives of the conditional characteristic function

and are in general explicitly known up to the solution of the Riccati

ODEs (9) and (10), the generalized method of moments is an alterna-

tive to maximum likelihood estimation (e.g. [2]).
