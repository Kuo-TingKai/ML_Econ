Abstract

In complex ﬁnancial systems, the sector structure and volatility clustering are respectively important
features of the spatial and temporal correlations. However, the microscopic generation mechanism of the
sector structure is not yet understood. Especially, how to produce these two features in one model remains
challenging. We introduce a novel interaction mechanism, i.e., the multi-level herding, in constructing
an agent-based model to investigate the sector structure combined with volatility clustering. According
to the previous market performance, agents trade in groups, and their herding behavior comprises the
herding at stock, sector and market levels. Further, we propose methods to determine the key model
parameters from historical market data, rather than from statistical ﬁtting of the results. From the
simulation, we obtain the sector structure and volatility clustering, as well as the eigenvalue distribution
of the cross-correlation matrix, for the New York and Hong Kong stock exchanges. These properties are
in agreement with the empirical ones. Our results quantitatively reveal that the multi-level herding is
the microscopic generation mechanism of the sector structure, and provide new insight into the spatio-
temporal interactions in ﬁnancial systems at the microscopic level.

Financial markets are complex systems with many-body interactions. In recent years, large amounts
of historical ﬁnancial data have sparked the interest of scientists in various ﬁelds, including physicists, to
quantitatively investigate the properties of the markets. With physical concepts and methods, plenty of
results have been obtained1–19.

From the view of physicists, the dynamic behavior and community structure of complex ﬁnancial

well-known that the volatilities are long-range correlated in time, which is the so-called volatility clus-
tering2, 3, 6, 7, 20. As to higher-order time correlations, it is discovered that the correlation between past
returns and future volatilities is negative for almost all the stock markets in the world4, 11, 21–24, while
currently the correlation is found to be positive only for the Chinese stock market11, 25. In other words,
the positive and negative returns inﬂuence the volatilities asymmetrically, which is known as the volatility
asymmetry. During the ﬁnancial crisis, the volatility asymmetry experiences local minima for developed
economies, while reaches local maxima for transition economies26. The spacial structure of the stock mar-
kets is explored by investigating the cross-correlation of stocks12, 18, 27–35. With the random matrix theory
(RMT), communities can be identiﬁed, which are usually associated with business sectors31–33. The cross-
correlation matrix C of price returns is analyzed to investigate the interactions between stocks12, 18, 29–35.
The largest eigenvalue of C deviates signiﬁcantly from the theoretical distribution of the Wishart ma-
trix, which is the cross-correlation matrix of non-correlated time series. This eigenvalue represents the
market mode, i.e., the price co-movement of the entire market, and the components of the corresponding
eigenvector is relatively uniform for all stocks. For developed markets, each eigenvector of other large
eigenvalues is dominated by the stocks in a certain business sector18, 30, 31. These large eigenvalues stand
for the sector modes.

The spatio-temporal correlations are theoretically crucial in the understanding of the price dynamics,
and practically useful for the optimization of the investment portfolio. The sector structure and volatility
clustering are, respectively, important features of the spatial and temporal correlations, which we focus
on in this paper. In recent years, various models have been proposed to study volatility clustering with
certain success6, 15, 36–39, but the models for the sector structure are phenomenological and usually without
interactions of investors12, 40. On the other hand, although many activities have been devoted to the sector
structure, its microscopic generation mechanism is not yet understood. Both the sector structure and
volatility clustering are important characteristics of stock markets, and it remains challenging how to
produce these two properties in one model.

As a powerful simulation technique, agent-based modeling is widely applied in various ﬁelds37, 38, 41–45.
Recently, an agent-based model is proposed for simulating the cumulative distribution of returns and
volatility clustering in stock markets15. The concept in constructing the model is to determine the key
parameters from empirical data instead of setting them artiﬁcially. In this paper, we construct an agent-
based model with a novel interaction mechanism, i.e., the multi-level herding, to investigate the sector
structure combined with volatility clustering. Further, we propose methods to determine the key model
parameters from historical market data rather than from statistical ﬁtting of the results.

Results

In stock markets, the temporal evolution of stock prices and interactions between stocks are complicated.
The price dynamics of a market naturally contains that of each individual stock. Recent research has
reported that the price dynamics of a market can be decomposed into diﬀerent modes of motion, such as
the market mode and sector mode18, 30, 31. The market mode is driven by interactions that are common
for all stocks in the market, and the sector mode is dominated by interactions of stocks within a sector.
Therefore, the price dynamics of a market is multi-level.
In ﬁnancial markets, herding is one of the
collective behaviors46–50. Investors cluster into groups when making decisions, and these groups can be
large. Since investors’ herding behavior is essential to the price dynamics, it may be multi-level as well.

In our model, we suppose that agents’ herding is composed of three diﬀerent levels, that is, herding at
stock, sector and market levels.

Multi-level herding. Our model is constructed based on the agents’ daily trading, i.e., buying,
selling and holding stocks. In the model, there are N agents, n stocks and nsec sectors. Each sector
contains n/nsec stocks. Every agent holds only one stock, which is randomly chosen from the n stocks.
In a real market, an investor may hold diﬀerent stocks. For simplicity, we suppose a reasonable investor
would trade his stocks separately, according to the performance of each stock, even if his operation is
based on an investment portfolio. Thus, the scenario for one investor holding, e.g., three stocks is basically
the same as that for three investors with each holding one stock.
The stock price of the i-th stock on day t is denoted by Yi(t), and the logarithmic price return is
Ri(t) = ln[Yi(t)/Yi(t − 1)]. Since investors’ trading decisions in a real market is based on the previous
stock performance of diﬀerent time scales, the investment horizon is introduced in our model for better
description of agents’ behavior. It has been reported in ref. 15 that the relative portion ξl of investors with
a l days investment horizon follows a power-law decay, ξl ∝ l−1.12. The maximum investment horizon is
l=1 l−1.12. Agents’
trading decisions are made according to the past price returns. On day t + 1, for an agent holding stock
m=0 Ri(t − m) represents the basis for estimating the previous
stock performance. We introduce a weighted average return R(cid:48)
i(t) to describe the basis of all agents
m=0 Ri(t − m), R(cid:48)

denoted by L. With the condition of(cid:80)L

In the model, agents’ herding behavior comprises the herding at stock, sector and market levels. For
convenience, we denote an agent holding stock i by “agent in stock i”. If stock i belongs to sector j, this
agent can be denoted by “agent in sector j” as well. A group formed by agents in stock i or by agents
in sector j is respectively denoted by “group in stock i” or “group in sector j”. The schematic diagram
of the multi-level herding is displayed in Fig. 1(a). The agents in a same stock ﬁrst cluster into groups.
This herding behavior at stock level is similar to the herding in other models which simulate only one
stock. In a real market, the stocks in a same sector share the characteristics of the sector. Thus in our
model, the groups in each sector further form larger groups, which is the herding at sector level. At last,
the groups formed at sector level cluster into even larger ones, since all sectors share common features of
the whole market. This is the herding at market level.

(i) Herding at stock level. The agents in each individual stock ﬁrst cluster into groups, which are
called I-groups. We introduce a herding degree DI to quantify the herding behavior at this level. On day
t, the herding degree for the i-th stock is

DI

i (t) = ¯ni(t)/Ni,

(2)

where ¯ni(t) denotes the average number of agents in each I-group, and Ni is the number of agents in
the i-th stock. Agents’ herding behavior is based on their estimation of the previous stock performance.
Since agents’ basis for estimation on day t is |R(cid:48)

i(t − 1)|, we set ¯ni(t) = |R(cid:48)

i(t − 1)|. Thus,

i(t − 1)|/Ni.
In the i-th stock, the number of I-groups is Ni/¯ni(t) = 1/DI
i (t), and the agents randomly join in one
of the I-groups. After the herding at stock level for all the n stocks, the number of I-groups in the j-th

Here i ∈ j represents the stock i in sector j.

(ii) Herding at sector level. The stocks in a same sector share the characteristics of the sector. At
this level, agents’ herding behavior is driven by the price co-movement of the sector, i.e., the prices of
stocks in a sector tend to rise and fall at the same time. Thus the I-groups in a same sector would further
form larger groups, which are called S-groups. Here we introduce HM and Hj to characterize the price
co-movement degrees for stocks in the whole market and in sector j, respectively. For the j-th sector, the
average number of I-groups in each S-group is set to be n · (Hj − HM ), which represents the pure price
co-movement of the sector. Therefore the herding degree is

j (t) = n · (Hj − HM )/N I

the percentage of connected I-groups, i.e., I-groups which co-move with each other. ¯H = ((cid:80)

(iii) Herding at market level. Agents’ herding behavior at this level is driven by the price co-movement
of the entire market. The S-groups in diﬀerent sectors share common features of the whole market, and
thus cluster into larger groups. These groups are called M-groups. In the model, both the herding degrees
at sector and market levels are computed based on the I-groups. The co-movement degree Hj represents
j Hj/nsec)
stands for the average percentage of connected I-groups. Since the group formation at this level is driven
by the price co-movement of the whole market, we suppose that the number of connected I-groups should
be the same for diﬀerent sectors and equal to ¯H · N I
j (t), and call
it the eﬀective number of I-groups for the j-th sector. N M
M (t). On
the other hand, n · HM represents the price co-movement for stocks in the whole market. Thus for the
S-groups in sector j, the herding degree at market level is

M (t). We denote ¯H · N I

In the formation of S-groups, the I-groups in a same stock tend not to join in a same S-group, otherwise
these I-groups would have gathered together during the herding at stock level. Similarly, in the formation
of M-groups, the S-groups in a same sector tend not to join in a same M-group. In other words, an I-group
prefers to join in an S-group with no other I-groups from the same stock, and an S-group prefers to join
in an M-group with no other S-groups from the same sector.

After the herding for the three levels, all agents cluster into M-groups. Since intraday trading is
not persistent in empirical trading data51, we suppose that each day only one trading decision is made
by every agent. The agents in a same M-group make a same trading decision with a same probability.
Considering each agent operates one share, we denote the decision of the α-th agent on day t by

and the probabilities of buying, selling and holding decisions of M-groups are denoted by Pbuy, Psell
and Phold, respectively. The same as the previous models15, 17, we suppose that the buying and selling

probabilities are equal, i.e., Pbuy = Psell = P , thus Phold = 1− 2P . The return of the i-th stock is deﬁned
as the diﬀerence of the demand and supply of this stock, i.e., the diﬀerence between the number of agents
buying and selling the stock,

Determination of parameters HM and Hj. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Hong
Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE) are the two representative stock markets considered in this paper. The
NYSE is one of the world’s most mature markets in the West, and the HKSE is an important market in
Asia. We collect the daily closing price data of 150 stocks in the NYSE and HKSE, respectively (Methods).
For the comparison of diﬀerent time series of returns, the normalized return ri(t) is introduced,

where (cid:104)···(cid:105) represents the average over time t, and σ =(cid:112)(cid:104)R2

ri(t) = [Ri(t) − (cid:104)Ri(t)(cid:105)]/σ,

(9)
i (t)(cid:105) − (cid:104)Ri(t)(cid:105)2 is the standard deviation of

Ri(t).

The parameters HM and Hj are introduced to characterize the price co-movement degrees for stocks
in the whole market and in sector j, respectively. Actually, the price co-movement of stocks can be
characterized by the similarities in the signs and amplitudes of the returns for diﬀerent stocks. We
denote the number of stocks in a sector by ns, thus ns = n/nsec. In the calculation of HM , we simply set
ns = n. On each day t, according to the sign of ri(t), these stocks are grouped into two market trends,
i.e., the rising and the falling. The amplitudes of the rising and falling trends on day t are deﬁned as
v+(t) and v−(t), respectively,

.

i (t)/ns
i (t)/ns

(cid:26) vd(t) = max{v+(t), v−(t)}

vn(t) = min{v+(t), v−(t)} .

The two trends are usually not in balance, and we suppose that these ns stocks are dominated by either of
the two trends, according to the magnitudes of v+(t) and v−(t). The amplitude vd(t) of the dominating
trend and the amplitude vn(t) of the non-dominating one are

(11)

We call the stocks grouped into the dominating trend the “dominating stocks”. The price co-movement
is a common property for all the ns stocks, hence the total amplitude is vd(t) − vn(t). Besides, we take
into consideration the similarity in the signs of the returns for these stocks. This similarity is deﬁned as
the percentage of the dominating stocks. The number of the dominating stocks is denoted by nd(t), and
the percentage is ζ(t) = nd(t)/ns. We take the average over time t for ζ(t) and vd(t) − vn(t), denoted

respectively by (cid:104)ζ(t)(cid:105) and(cid:10)vd(t) − vn(t)(cid:11). Then, the co-movement degree HM and Hj are

(cid:26) HM = (cid:104)ζ(t)(cid:105) ·(cid:10)vd(t) − vn(t)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:12)market

.

(12)

Here |market and |j-th sector represent the calculations for the stocks in the whole market and in the j-th
sector, respectively. These parameters for the NYSE and HKSE are shown in Table 1.

Simulation of the model. The number of stocks is n = 150 and the number of sectors is nsec = 5,
which are the same as those of the empirical data we collect for the NYSE and HKSE (Methods). We
set the number of agents N to be 600, 000, and the maximum investment horizon L to be 1000 trading
days (Methods).
In our model, the investment horizons of 94 percent of agents are shorter than 500
days (Methods), which is similar to the previous research15. Estimated from the historical market data
and investment report, the buying or selling probability is P = 0.363 for the NYSE and P = 0.317 for

6

i(t) according to equation (1), and then DI

the HKSE (Methods). With HM and Hj determined for the NYSE and HKSE respectively, our model
produces the time series Ri(t) of each stock. The schematic diagram of the simulation procedure is
displayed in Fig. 1(b):
Initially, the returns of the ﬁrst L time steps are set to be 0 for all the n stocks. On day t, we calculate
agents’ basis R(cid:48)
i (t) according to equation (3) for each stock i.
The agents in the i-th stock randomly join in one of the 1/DI
i (t) I-groups. Next, the I-groups in the j-th
sector join in one of the 1/DS
j (t) S-groups, and then each S-group in the j-th sector joins in one of the
1/DM
j (t) M-groups. After the herding for these three levels, the agents in a same M-group make a same
trading decision (buy, sell or hold) with the same probability (Pbuy, Psell or Phold). Thus the returns
for each stock on day t are calculated with equation (8). The groups disband after their decisions are
made. Repeating this procedure, we obtain the time series of returns for all the stocks in the market.
For equilibration, the ﬁrst 10, 000 data points of returns are abandoned for each stock, and the length of
the time series from simulation is the same as that of the empirical data.

Simulation results.
From the calculation for the simulated returns, we obtain the sector structure and volatility clustering.
For each stock i, the volatility clustering is characterized by the auto-correlation function of volatilities2, 6,
which is deﬁned as

function of volatilities averaged over all stocks is A(t) =(cid:80)

(13)
i = (cid:104)|ri(t(cid:48))|2(cid:105)−(cid:104)|ri(t(cid:48))|(cid:105)2, and (cid:104)···(cid:105) represents the average over time t(cid:48). Thus, the auto-correlation

Here A0

NYSE and HKSE, A(t) for the simulations is in agreement with that for the empirical data.

To characterize the spacial structure, we ﬁrst compute the equal-time cross-correlation matrix C 12, 29, 52,

of which each element is

Cij = (cid:104)ri(t)rj(t)(cid:105).

(14)
Here (cid:104)···(cid:105) represents the average over time t, and Cij measures the correlation between the returns of
the i-th and j-th stocks. From the deﬁnition, C is a real symmetric matrix with Cii = 1, and the values
of other elements Cij are in the interval [−1, 1]. The ﬁrst, second and third largest eigenvalues of C
are denoted by λ0, λ1 and λ2, respectively. Now we focus on the components ui(λ) of the eigenvector
for the three largest eigenvalues. The empirical result of the NYSE is displayed in Fig. 3(a). For λ0,
the components of the corresponding eigenvector are relatively uniform. The eigenvectors of λ1 and λ2
are dominated by sector (5) and sector (1) respectively, with the components signiﬁcantly larger than
those in other sectors. These features are reproduced in our simulation, and the results are shown in
Fig. 3(b). The empirical result of the HKSE is displayed in Fig. 4(a). The eigenvectors of λ1 and λ2
are respectively dominated by sector (1) and sector (2), and these features are simulated by our model,
shown in Fig. 4(b). For the HKSE, the scenario is somewhat complicated53, since a company in the
HKSE usually runs various business. As a result, the components of the eigenvector of λ0 are not so
uniform as those in the NYSE. The dominating sectors for λ1 and λ2 are less prominent, especially for
λ2.

Also, the distribution of the eigenvalues is calculated from the simulated returns. As displayed in
Fig. 5, for the NYSE and HKSE, the bulk of the distribution of eigenvalues and the three largest eigen-
values from the simulation are in agreement with those from the empirical data.

Discussion

In ﬁnancial markets, the sector structure and volatility clustering are respectively important features
of the spatial and temporal correlations. However, the microscopic generation mechanism of the sector
structure is not yet understood. Especially, how to produce these two features in one model remains
challenging.

7

To investigate the sector structure combined with volatility clustering, we construct an agent-based
model with a novel interaction mechanism, that is, the multi-level herding. The model is based on
the individual and collective behaviors of investors in real markets. According to the previous market
performance, agents trade in groups, and their herding behavior comprises the herding at stock, sector and
market levels. The key parameters, HM and Hj, are introduced to characterize the price co-movement
degrees for stocks in the whole market and in sector j, respectively. We propose methods to determine
these parameters from historical market data rather than from statistical ﬁtting of the results. Other
parameters L and P are also estimated from the empirical ﬁndings.

With parameters determined for the NYSE and HKSE respectively, our model produces the corre-
sponding time series of returns. From these time series, we obtain the sector structure and volatility
clustering, as well as the eigenvalue distribution of the cross-correlation matrix C. These properties are
in agreement with the empirical ones. Our results quantitatively reveal that the multi-level herding is
the microscopic generation mechanism of the sector structure, and provide new insight into the spatio-
temporal interactions in ﬁnancial systems at the microscopic level. The mechanism of the multi-level
herding, including the concept of characterizing the price co-movement with parameters HM and Hj, can
also be applied to other complex systems with similar community structures.

Methods

Data. Our data are obtained from “Yahoo! Finance” (http://ﬁnance.yahoo.com). We collect the daily
data of closing prices of 150 large-cap stocks from 5 business sectors in the NYSE, i.e., the Basic Materials,
Consumer Goods, Industrial Goods, Services and Utility, with 30 stocks from each sector. The data are
from Jan., 1990 to Dec., 2006 with 4286 data points for every stock. For comparison, we also collect the
daily closing price data of 150 stocks in the HKSE to form 5 sectors, with 30 stocks in each sector, and most
of these stocks are large-cap stocks. The data are from Jan, 2003 to Sep., 2011 with 2146 data points for
each stock. The sector structure of the HKSE is somewhat complicated53, since a company in the HKSE
usually runs various business. According to the dominating stocks of eigenvectors of the cross-correlation
matrix C, the sectors in the HKSE are not so strict as those in the NYSE, and may be composed of
two business sectors. Speciﬁcally, the second sector comprises 14 stocks from the Conglomerates and 16
stocks from the Industrial Goods. The third sector consists of 12 stocks from the Basic Materials and
18 stocks from the Technology. The stocks in other three sectors are, respectively, from the Real Estate
Development, Services and Consumer Goods.

Parameter N and L. To simulate the properties of a real stock market, the number of agents N
should not be too small, since we suppose that every agent operates only one share of a stock. We set
N = 600, 000, i.e., 4000 agents holding a same stock on average. The simulation results are not sensitive
to N . For example, we obtain almost the same results for N = 450, 000 or N = 750, 000. N has no
inﬂuence on the sector structure and the eigenvalue distribution of the matrix C, and slightly aﬀects
the amplitude of the auto-correlation function A(t) of volatilities averaged over stocks. The investment
horizons of investors range from one day to more than one year54. Considering there could be some
investors with long investment horizon in the stock market, we set L = 1000 trading days in our model.
Thus according to the relative portion of investors, the investment horizons of 94 percent of agents are
shorter than 500 days, suggesting that most agents do not estimate previous market performance over a
too long time period. L aﬀects the temporal and spatial properties little. Similar with N , the simulation
results are almost the same for, e.g., L = 800 or L = 1200.

Determination of parameter P . We ﬁrst determine the daily buying, selling and holding probabil-
ities of a single investor in a real market, which is denoted by pbuy, psell and phold respectively. pbuy and
psell are supposed to be equal, i.e., pbuy = psell = p. The time series of returns of the 150 stocks in the
NYSE are from Jan., 1990 to Dec., 2006. According to “The 2010 Institutional Investment Report”55,
the average percentage of institutional holdings of shares in the top 1000 U.S. corporations during these

8

years is 60.3 percent (see Supplementary Information S2). There are two kinds of investors in stock
markets, that is individual and institutional investors. The percentage of holding shares for the individ-
ual investors is thus 39.7 percent. According to ref. 15, the yearly average ratio between the number of
shares an investor trades and the number of shares he holds is 1.64. This ratio corresponds to the yearly
average trading times of an investor. Since institutional investors contribute little of the trading times15,
we ignore their trades. So the yearly trading times for an individual investor is 1.64/0.397 = 4.13. Since
there are 250 trading days in every year, the daily trading probability is 4.13/250 = pbuy(t)+psell(t) = 2p.
Therefore, p is 0.00826 for the NYSE. For the HKSE, the corresponding empirical data are not available
to us, and we assume that p is 0.00826 as well.

The agents in a same M-group are connected. We suppose that if one agent in the group decides
to buy or sell the stock, the whole group would make the same decision.
In the model, the average
number of agents in an M-group is n · HM . Therefore, the buying or selling probability of an M-group is
P = 1 − (1 − p)n·HM . Thus, P is 0.363 for the NYSE and 0.317 for the HKSE.
