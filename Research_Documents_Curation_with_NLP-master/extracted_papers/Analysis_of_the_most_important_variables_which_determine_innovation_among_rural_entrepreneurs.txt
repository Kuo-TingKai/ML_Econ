Abstract 

Purpose ‚Äì The present research aims to highlight the main factors influencing the development 
of entrepreneurial innovation in a rural environment and to perform an empirical study with the 
purpose of assessing the main problems in rural development. 
Methodology/approach  ‚Äì  The  research  performed  is  mostly  of  a  quantitative  nature,  being 
based on the use of the questionnaire as research tool, although some of the questions were 
raised in order to collect respondents‚Äô impressions and opinions which would form the object fo 
qualitative research.  
Findings  ‚ÄìThe  research  outlines  the  fact  that  in  the  rural  entrepreneurship  innovation  is 
performed  with  minimal  investment  in  new  technologies  and  depends  on  the  entrepreneur‚Äôs 
involvement in Innovation Systems Network. It was also noted that most of the entrepreneurs in 
rural environment are non-innovators.  
Research limitations/implications ‚Äì The research question started to assess the key elements 
which identify the role of innovation among entrepreneurs in rural areas. Based on these facts, 
we determined the variables that make entrepreneurial innovation in rural areas, followed by the 
analysis of the most significant variable rural entrepreneurs in the Mures county. 
Practical implications ‚Äì This result can support the creation of the future model of innovation in 
rural entrepreneurship. 
Originality/value  ‚Äì  There  are  relatively  few  studies  addressing  the  problem  of  research 
regarding innovation in rural areas. The emphasis is on national and regional studies, without 
differentiating between the rural and urban areas. Thus, the purpose of the analysis is to add a 
descriptive background related to the innovation at a micro-economic level in the rural areas.  
Key words: Innovation, rural entrepreneurship. 
 
 
 
The European Union is beginning to pay greater attention to the development of rural areas, 
providing  more  than  simple  agricultural  support.  With  the  growing  popularity  of  the  idea  that 
starting and developing a business may constitute the best strategy for rural development, there 
are new reports from various international sources which are now questioning the advantages 
brought by innovation in entrepreneurship in order to support the economic development of rural 
areas. (OSLO Manual 2005). 
 
 
 
This is how Wortman (1990) defined rural entrepreneurship: "rural entrepreneurship implies the 
creation of a new organization which introduces a new product, serves or creates a new market 
or uses a new technology in rural areas‚Äù. This definition contains elements of innovation which

can potentially affect a great part of the rural community in which the entrepreneurial activity will 
take place. 
 
The  concept  of  rural  development  constitutes  a  subject  of  continuous  debate,  especially  with 
regard to the relative importance of its sectorial and territorial dimension. Rural development may 
be defined as ‚Äúeconomic, social and environmental development as well as the development of 
administrations and territories characterized by low levels of population density, massive support 
as a form of subsistence agricultural land and non-urban settlements structure‚Äù. (Fieldsend A., 
Kov√°cs K., 2007).  
 
The notion of rural development comprises all the actions directed towards improving the life 
quality  of  the  populations  in  the  rural  areas,  in  order  to  preserve  the  natural  and  cultural 
landscape  which  is  a  guarantee  of  sustainable  development  of  rural  areas  according  to  the 
conditions and specificity of the land. The rural development program may contain, according to 
conditions  and  necessities,  the  development  of  infrastructure,  agriculture,  tourism,  small  and 
medium-sized enterprises as well as the creation of jobs, but also ideas regarding the protection 
of the environment, education, community development (www.madr.ro). 
 
At a certain extent, the economic objective of an entrepreneur and the social objective of rural 
development are much more interrelated in the rural environment than in the urban areas. For 
this  reason,  rural  entrepreneurship  is  mainly  community-based,  having  strong  and  extended 
family bonds and a relatively strong impact on the rural community (Hoy, Vaught ,1980). 
 
The  development  of  entrepreneurship  means  more  than  building  a  system  of  support  for 
entrepreneurs.  It  is  about  creating  entrepreneurial  communities,  changing  the  culture  of  rural 
areas and people so that they should adopt an entrepreneurial potential.  
 
 
 
The main objective of this study is to analyze the level of innovation of rural entrepreneurs by 
analyzing the decision making strategies of small entrepreneurs. In order to fulfill this objective, 
we have set a series of specific research objectives:   
 
O1. Identify the main elements regarding the role of innovation in rural entrepreneurship; 
O2.  Determine  the  variable  elements  composing  entrepreneurial  innovation  in  the  rural 
environment; 
O3. Analyze and interpret the most important variable elements identified in the Mures county.  
 
In order to contribute to the fulfillment of the research objectives, we formulated the following 
research hypotheses whose test and ratification are detailed further on. 
 
H1: The entrepreneur‚Äôs level of innovation depends on his involvement in business networks.  
H2: the level of innovation in rural environment is low because of the low level of EU grants and 
of the low investment capital for new technologies.  
 
The quantitative analysis of the existing databases, both individually and in connection with the 
results of the survey, are intended to reveal interesting features regarding the factors determining 
the level of innovation in rural entrepreneurship. The survey contained information regarding the 
perception of the entrepreneurs on the various factors determining the innovation process, such 
as the development of the area, strategies of business development and the importance and 
relation with the business environment.  
 
The  questionnaire  was  distributed  to  a  number  of  500  entrepreneurs  consisting  of  micro-
enterprises,  small  and  medium-sized  enterprises  as  well  as  physical  persons,  individual 
businesses and family businesses from the Mures county. With a range of response of 47,4%, 
the final sample of the study contains 237 entrepreneurs.  

Objectives, hypotheses, methodology 

238 

If  we  compare  the  demographical  date  of  the  sampled  businesses  with  the  ones  found  in  a 
statistical database, we find that they are comparable regarding the domain of activity, the level of 
employment, the years of functioning and juridical personality.  
 
The questionnaire was grouped in 5 categories, according to the five essential elements which 
were identified: location, the entrepreneur‚Äôs characteristics, the internal features of the business, 
the external features of the business and the characteristics of the innovation. Each of them also 
comprises variable elements which were included in the analysis.  
 
Innovation,  as  the  main  element  of  the  research,  is  described  by  four  variable  dependent 
components:  types  of  innovation  (process,  product,  marketing,  organizational)  brought  to  the 
development  of  the  business,  the  degree  of  novelty  implied  by  the  innovation  strategy,  the 
entrepreneurship innovation level determined by the entrepreneur claims actions contained in the 
company's  strategy  and  the  level  of  excellence  corresponding  to  the  process  of  innovation 
generation and adoption by the entrepreneur. 
 
 
 
Consequent to analyzing the main factors impacting the development of rural entrepreneurship in 
the Mures county, which was the object of previous personal research and after identifying the 
key-elements which would be analyzed (see figure 1), we designed a series of variables due to 
the multitude of the indicators to be measured and to their variety in the studied domains. These 
variables will be assessed by means of the questionnaire. The variables which were taken into 
account in this study were organized under the form of a conceptual model of analysis, as you 
can see in figure 2.

Figure 2 Variable analysis model 

 
 
The  conceptual  model  of  analysis  is  composed  of  two  types  of  variables.  The  independent 
variables are those with an independent behavior and which influence the dependent variables, 
who determining expected results in analysis. (Hern√°ndez, Fern√°ndez, Baptista, 2006). 
 
The  independent  variables  are  grouped  in  four  main  categories  of  analysis:  Location, 
Entrepreneur  features,  the  internal  features  of  the  business  and  the  external  features  of  the 
business  ‚Äì  the  business  networks.  In  their  turn,  these  are  formed  of  several  variables  which 
influence innovation, the main variable to be analyzed.   
 
The dependent variables are the resulted variables. It is desired that their value is as high as 
possible. They are influenced at a greater or smaller extent by independent variables. In our 
case,  we  have  four  dependent  variables,  one  of  a  quantitative  type  and  three  qualitative

Process and interpretation of results  

dependent  variables  by  means  of  which  we  try  to  analyze  the  level  of  innovation  in  rural 
entrepreneurship. 
 
 
 
The first part of data analysis starts from descriptive statistics and contains a set of techniques / 
methods of organization and synthetic presentation of the collective data in order to shape an 
overall image regarding the main characteristics of the individual variables. One of the statistical 
methods which were used implies a descriptive analysis of the alternative variables in the study 
through the frequency analysis by using the mean score of influence (Moica 2013). 
 
Tables  1  and  2  show  the  corresponding  values  of  the  dependent  and  independent  variables 
analyzed  in  descriptive  statistics  and  their  review  of  maximal  values  which  are  far  from  the 
margins for the average confidence interval of 95%.

Regarding the profile of the entrepreneurs who are the object of the present sample, we analyzed 
a series of economic agents registered in the rural areas of the Mures county, from different 
sectors. 25,7% of the businesses are from agriculture, 23,6% from commerce and 21,2% from 
industry. According to the size of the business, in terms of the number of employees, almost 83% 
are micro-businesses, 33 are small businesses and 8 are medium businesses. From the point of 
view of the juridical status, 51% of the respondents have no juridical personality, being physical 
persons, individual businesses, family businesses, while a number of 116 respondents are trade 
companies. 21% of the entrepreneurs declared that they managed to attract EU funding and 90% 
of them resorted to a consultancy company.  
 
Consequent  to  the  application  of  the  Parametric  Correlation  Analysis  by  means  of  the  SPPS 
program,  7  new  variables  (main  components)  resulted.  The  number  is  too  big  for  a  rigorous 
interpretation of the information in the study. Analyzing the values of the correlation coefficients, it 
can be noted that there are both positive and negative correlations. Thus, it may be observed 
that: 
‚Ä¢  The entrepreneurs‚Äô level of innovation is positively correlated at an average intensity with the 
juridical status and the company seniority, but also with the degree of novelty implied by the 
innovation strategy.

‚Ä¢  The consultancy regarding funding programs is averagely and directly correlated (0,455) 
‚Ä¢  The consultancy regarding external funding is directly and strongly correlated (0,717) 
‚Ä¢  External  funding  is  averagely  and  directly  correlated  with  the  process  of  innovation 
‚Ä¢  External funding is averagely and directly correlated with clusters and associations (0,407) 
 
Following the second processing of the Parametric Correlation Analysis, by eliminating the seven 
variables mentioned above, resulted a number of 4 main components which explains 61,58% of 
the total variance of the 13 variables which remained in the study. The structure of each of the 
four  components  is  rendered  in  table  3.  From  analyzing  the  structure  of  each  component,  it 
follows that:  
‚Ä¢  The  first  main  component  CP1  is  formed  of  the  following  initial  variables:  consultancy, 
‚Ä¢  The  second  main  component  CP2  is  formed  of  the  following  initial  variables:  turnover, 
‚Ä¢  The third main component CP3 is formed of the following initial variables: company seniority, 
‚Ä¢  The fourth main component CP4 is formed of the following initial variables: collaboration with 

external funding, funding programs, innovation generation process and location; 
company size and investment expenses;  
degree of innovation and the degree of novelty of the innovation strategy; 
institutions and clusters and associations.

Following the non-hierarchical cluster analysis, one may note how the new main components are 
characterized  by  means  of  the  13  variables.  In  order  to  find  the  number  of  clusters,  we  first 
applied  the  non-hierarchical  cluster  analysis  ith  the  Ward  distance.  Based  on  these  data,  3 
clusters were established. In order to see how the three clusters were formed on the 4 main 
components, we used the test k-means ‚Äìcluster (Dixon 1992, Hitt, Hoskisson si Kim 1997). Thus: 
‚Ä¢  cluster C1 is defined by variables which form the main component C1, but it is not defined by 
‚Ä¢  cluster C2 is defined by variables which form the main component CP3 but it is not defined 
‚Ä¢  cluster C3 is defined by variables which form the main component CP2 but it is not defined 
 
By analyzing the information in table 4, it may be  noted that all the three clusters are statistically 
significant, according to the result of the ANOVA test. In order to obtain further details regarding 
the content of the three clusters according to the innovation indicators we applied the ‚Äúcrosstab‚Äù 
analysis between these variables (Sorensen & Stuart 2000). The results are presented in tables 
5, 6 and 7.

Discussion and conclusions 

 
 
 
After  processing  the  statistical  data,  it  can  be  observed  that  the  level  of  innovation  of  rural 
entrepreneurs is low. 54% of them fall into the category of Non-innovators and only 20% are 
characterized  by  high  degrees  of  innovation.  This  result  is  mainly  influenced  by  variables: 
consultancy, funding programs, external funding and investment expenses, which confirms our 
study hypothesis H2: the level of innovation in rural entrepreneurship is low due to the low level of 
EU fund attraction and of the low level of capital invested in new technologies.  
 
The category of Non-innovators prevails in almost all the variables on the analyzed innovation. A 
higher presence of the second category of innovators is only noted through the analysis of the 
innovation generation process. This leads us to believe that rural entrepreneurs started actions of 
innovation generation, but, for various reasons, these entrepreneurs did not manage to complete 
the process. These reasons are explained by the entrepreneurs‚Äô lack of appurtenance to different 
clusters  and  associations  and  of  collaboration  with  various  institutions,  which  confirms 
hypothesis H1 of the study. 
 
The research data confirm the low level of innovation in rural entrepreneurship as well as the lack 
of  entrepreneurial  culture  and  recommend  an  intensification  of  the  efforts  directed  towards 
entrepreneurial education and stimulation of creativity.
