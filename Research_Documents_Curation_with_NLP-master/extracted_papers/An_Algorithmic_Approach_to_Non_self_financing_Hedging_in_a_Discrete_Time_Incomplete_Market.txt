We present an algorithm producing a dynamic non-self-ﬁnancing hedging strategy in an
incomplete market corresponding to investor-relevant risk criterion. The optimization is
a two stage process that ﬁrst determines admissible model parameters that correspond
to the market price of the option being hedged. The second stage applies various merit
functions to bootstrapped samples of model residuals to choose an optimal set of model
parameters from the admissible set. Results are presented for options traded on the New
York Stock Exchange.

1. Introduction

Pricing and hedging of ﬁnancial assets in incomplete markets is an active research
area in mathematical ﬁnance. One of the possible ways to produce a model of an
incomplete market in discrete time setting is to assume that stock price relative
changes (jumps) can take more that two values as opposed to the classical binomial
model of Cox-Ross-Rubinstein. In [1], [2], and [3] an incomplete market in which
stock price jumps follow a multinomial distribution is studied. In [1] the no-arbitrage
option price interval is studied, [2] and [3] discuss risk minimization aspects in option
pricing and hedging.

The multinomial model has been further extended to the case where stock price
jumps are distributed over a bounded interval and options under consideration have
convex pay-oﬀ functions. In [4], the upper and lower bounds for no-arbitrage prices
of a European contingent claim with convex pay-oﬀ are obtained. The series of works
by A. Nagaev et al. (see [5], [6], [7], and [8]) are devoted to asymptotic behavior of
the residual value of a minimum cost super-hedge. The residual value occurs as a
result of non-self-ﬁnancing dynamic hedging strategy of an option seller introduced
and discussed in [5].

A signiﬁcant proportion of research on option pricing and hedging in incom-
plete markets constructs self-ﬁnancing trading strategies that satisfy both a pri-
mary no-arbitrage condition and secondary conditions on portfolio risk and return.
A comprehensive survey of modern methodologies can be found in [9]. A number
of articles that deal with frictions in markets, shortfall risks and quadratic hedging
(all producing incomplete markets) can be found in the recent compendium [10].

Less prevalent is the study of non-self-ﬁnancing trading strategies in similar
economic environments. The encyclopedic reference [11] and the more modest [12]
both illuminate option pricing with consumption, the model which is similar to the
work presented here. Our work is an initial investigation in the algorithmic study
of non-self-ﬁnancing strategies discussed in [5] and [8]. We explore the short term
behavior of the residual value of a minimum cost super-hedge, whose long term
behavior was studied by Nagaev et al.

Assuming independent and identically distributed jumps in the underlying stock
process, we use historical data and a bootstrap simulation process to develop an
algorithm producing a dynamic non-self ﬁnancing hedging strategy. The resulting
hedging strategy constructs a residual sequence with improved investor risk crite-
ria as compared to other possible hedging strategies. No additional assumptions
are placed on the underlying stock price jump process other than having bounded
support. An algorithmic approach similar to our use of bootstrap simulation, but
having a diﬀerent theoretical foundation and goals can be found in [13].

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We develop the discrete
time ﬁnancial model in section 2. The notion of the residual value of a minimum
cost super-hedge is developed in sections 3 through 5. The algorithm is described in
section 6. Algorithm implementation and illustrative results are presented in 7. We
conclude with some remarks in section 8 and directions for further study in section
9.

2. Discrete Time Financial Model

Following the theoretical development in [5], our discrete time ﬁnancial model con-
sists of two fundamental assets and a derivative security.

(1) A risk-free bond with ﬁxed interest rate r, evolving from an initial value b0 > 0

at time t = 0 to bk at time t = k as

bk = b0(1 + r)k

(2) A risky stock evolving from an initial value s0 at time t = 0 to sk at time t = k

as

sk = s0ξ1ξ2 · · · ξk

where ξk = sk
are assumed to be independent and identically distributed ran-
sk−1
dom variables with probability distribution having support equal to a bounded
interval [D, U ]. No further assumptions are made on the distribution function

for the ξk. However, this assumption is suﬃcient to render our ﬁnancial market
incomplete.

(3) A derivative security with convex payoﬀ function f . For our numerical investi-
gations, we use a European call option on the stock. We take the position of an
option seller who wishes to hedge the potential liability of the sold derivative
being exercised.

Our goal is to develop and evaluate an algorithm that will determine a dy-
namic, non-self-ﬁnancing hedging strategy consisting of a portfolio of our stock and
bond assets in our incomplete market. The portfolio will approximately hedge the
derivative security and will satisfy additional criteria, based on the deviation of the
portfolio value from the required hedging value, that are meaningful to the investor.

3. Super-hedging Portfolio

Based on a convexity argument, [5] showed that when the parameters D and U are
known, there is a minimum cost super-hedge whose value at every time instant t = k
is greater than or equal to the value of the derivative security. This super-hedge is
a portfolio of γk stocks and βk bonds at time t = k described by

γk(U, D) =

gk+1(U, D, skU ) − gk+1(U, D, skD)

sk (U − D)

βk(U, D) =

U gk+1(U, D, skD) − Dgk+1(U, D, skU )

(1 + r)bk(U − D)

(3.1)

p(U, D) =

(3.3)

(3.4)

n is the number of periods to expiration, C j
n−k is the binomial coeﬃcient, and f is a
convex pay-oﬀ function. At each time instant k, the dynamic super-hedge portfolio
constructed in the prior period is liquidated and the proceeds are used to construct
a new portfolio for the current period. The liquidation value of the prior period
portfolio is given by

vk(U, D) = γk−1(U, D)sk + βk−1(U, D)bk

=

U − ξk
U − D

gk(U, D, sk−1D) +

ξk − D
U − D

gk(U, D, sk−1U )

(3.5)

The funds required to construct the new period portfolio, or set-up cost, is given
by

X k(U, D) = gk(U, D, sk−1ξk)

(3.6)

(see section 4 for more detail). The liquidation value (3.5) will exceed the set-up
cost (3.6) producing a residual amount δk

δk(U, D) =

U − ξk
U − D

gk(U, D, sk−1D) +

gk(U, D, sk−1U ) − gk(U, D, sk−1ξk).

ξk − D
U − D

(3.7)
In this case where U and D are known, and consequently D ≤ ξk ≤ U, it follows
from the convexity of the pay-oﬀ function f that the residual is non-negative:

δk(U, D) ≥ 0,

k = 1, . . . , n.

(3.8)

In this fashion, each stock price process path {sk} maps to a corresponding se-
quence of non-negative residuals {δk(U, D)}, which are withdrawn after each port-
folio liquidation prior to the construction of the next time period super-hedge. The
accumulated value of the withdrawn residuals at maturity is given by

∆n(U, D) = δ1(U, D)(1 + r)n−1 + δ2(U, D)(1 + r)n−2 + · · · + δn(U, D).

(3.9)

For the remainder of this paper we will assume a European call option pay-oﬀ

function f,

f (s) = (s − K)+

(3.10)

where K is the option strike price.

4. Model Properties

Ruschendorf [4] and Nagaev [5] document a number of properties of our ﬁnancial
market model which will illuminate our algorithmic design approach. In particular,
the incompleteness of the market model is manifested in an open interval (xk, X k)
(k = 0, . . . , n − 1) of no-arbitrage option prices. The end points of the interval are
shown to be

X k(U, D) = gk(U, D, sk)
xk(U, D) = (1 + r)−(n−k) (cid:0)sk(1 + r)n−k − K(cid:1)+

where K is the option strike price and gk is deﬁned in (3.3).

At every time instant t = k (k = 0, . . . , n − 1), the open interval
(xk(U, D), X k(U, D)) is the set of no-arbitrage option prices. For the option seller,
the upper bound X k(U, D) is the demarcation between risk sharing with the option
buyer (if the option sale price is below X k(U, D)) and the potential for arbitrage
proﬁt (if the option sale price is at or above X k(U, D)).

Let us now replace the parameters U, D with a pair of numbers u, d such that

D ≤ d < u ≤ U

and let us construct the portfolio with the time t = k set-up cost

xk(u, d) = gk(u, d, sk),

(4.1)

(4.2)

September 15, 2018 2:20 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE

algorithmic˙paper

5

where gk is deﬁned in (3.3). It is straightforward to show that for any choice of
d and u satisfying (4.1), the resulting portfolio set-up cost (4.2) falls within the
no-arbitrage option price interval

xk(U, D) ≤ xk(u, d) ≤ X k(U, D), k = 0, . . . , n.

We will refer to the value xk(u, d) as a rational price of the option.

5. Choice of (u, d) Pair

As a practical matter, we do not know the actual values of D and U . Suppose we
choose a (u, d) pair that is within the D and U values:

D ≤ d < u ≤ U

and suppose that for any given stock price process {sk}, we deﬁne the hedging
portfolio strategy

(γk(u, d), βk(u, d)), k = 0, . . . , n − 1

(5.1)

where γk(u, d) and βk(u, d) are deﬁned in (3.1) and (3.2) respectively, with the
boundary parameters U, D replaced with the values u, d. The above portfolio strat-
egy will produce a residual sequence

δk(u, d), k = 1, . . . , n

(5.2)

where δk(u, d) is deﬁned in (3.7), with U, D replaced by u, d. It is straightforward
to show that

• δk(u, d) > 0 if d < ξk < u
• δk(u, d) = 0 if ξk = d or ξk = u
• δk(u, d) < 0 if D < ξk < d or u < ξk < U.

In order to maintain the dynamic portfolio strategy deﬁned by (5.1), at each time
step k = 1, . . . , n the investor will withdraw the residual (5.2) from the liquidated
proceeds when δk(u, d) > 0 and add the amount when δk(u, d) < 0. The risk-free
growth of the local residuals δk(u, d) produces an accumulated residual deﬁned by

∆n(u, d) = δ1(u, d)(1 + r)n−1 + δ2(u, d)(1 + r)n−2 + · · · + δn(u, d).

(5.3)

We would like to stress here that the hedging portfolio strategy constructed
above is in general non-self-ﬁnancing. An investor who utilizes our dynamic hedging
strategy will want to choose values for d and u that determine a residual sequence
with desirable statistical characteristics. It is the choice of the model parameter
values d and u based on the statistical characteristics of the residual sequence that
constitutes our algorithm design.

6. Risk Minimization on (u, d) Contours

We propose a two-stage algorithm for choosing a (u, d) pair. The ﬁrst stage reduces
the set of (u, d) pairs under consideration by imposing a market calibration con-
straint. The second stage chooses from this reduced set a pair that optimizes one
of a number of investor-relevant statistical properties of the residual sequence.

6.1. Market Calibrated Price Contour

The ﬁrst stage of our proposed risk minimization procedure is the selection of a set
of (u, d) pairs consistent with the quoted market option price.

Each (u, d) pair uniquely determines a portfolio strategy that is dependent upon
the realized values of the stock and bond processes. At the initial time t = 0, the
portfolio strategy determined by a (u, d) pair speciﬁes an initial portfolio consisting
of β0(u, d) bonds and γ0(u, d) stocks where β0(u, d) and γ0(u, d) are deﬁned in (3.2)
and (3.1) with k = 0, U = u and D = d. At time t = 0 the set-up cost of the so
constructed portfolio is

g0(u, d, s0) = (1 + r)−n

n

X

j=0

C j

n[p(u, d)]j[1 − p(u, d)]n−j(s0ujdn−j − K)+

(6.1)

where p(u, d) is given by (3.4) (with U, D replaced by u, d) and s0 is the stock price
at t = 0. To calibrate the choice of (u, d) pairs to the market price of the option,
we need to set g0(u, d, s0) equal to the option time t = 0 market price x0 :

g0(u, d, s0) = x0.

While the choice of (u, d) uniquely determines a portfolio set-up cost, specifying a
portfolio set-up cost determines a contour of (u, d) pairs since there are a multiplicity
of portfolios with identical set-up costs. This contour consists of the set

Σ = {(u, d) : c0(u, d) = c∗},

c∗ =

x0
s0

(6.2)

where c0 is the normalized value surface

c0(u, d) =

(see Figure 1).

(6.3)

Computationally, we utilize contour construction software to compute a ﬁnite
number of (u, d) pairs satisfying (6.2). It is this set of (u, d) pairs that is used by
the second stage of our algorithm.

6.2. Investor-relevant Choice Criteria

The second stage of the two-stage algorithm selects a unique (u, d) pair on the
market calibrated contour Σ deﬁned in (6.2) that optimizes one of several investor

risk criteria. Each (u, d) pair on the market-calibrated contour Σ determines a
dynamic hedging portfolio strategy. For a given stock price process {sk}, the (u, d)-
determined portfolios produce a sequence of residuals δk(u, d), each representing a
residual proﬁt/loss for an investor (see section 5 for details). This sequence is an
economic measure of the consequence of choosing model parameters (u, d) and the
associated dynamic hedging portfolio.

There are several criteria that convert this sequence into a scalar measure of
investor risk, each reﬂecting some aspect of the option seller attitude towards risk.
We thus have the following situation. Fix a (u, d) pair at time t = 0. Each poten-
tial stock price time series {sk}, k = 1, · · · , n determines a sequence of residuals
{δk(u, d), k = 1, · · · , n}. A particular choice of a risk criterion reduces the sequence
{δk(u, d)} to a single scalar value of risk. To judge the acceptability of the (u, d)
pair under the chosen risk measure, we simulate a number of stock price time series
and collect the corresponding sample of scalar risk values. An appropriate sample
statistic (mean value or probability of a desirable event) is then computed from the
sample as the utility value of the (u, d) pair. The behavior of the sample statistic as
the (u, d) pair is varied over the market-calibrated contour determines the optimal
choice of (u, d).

There are four criteria that we consider for choosing a unique (u, d) pair.

• Maximize the likelihood of a positive accumulated residual:

• Maximize the expected accumulated proﬁt

(u,d)∈ Σ

(6.6)

(6.7)

The ﬁrst criterion (6.4) interprets a positive residual as a proﬁt, and chooses
a (u, d) pair that has the highest probability of a net proﬁt. In the absence of
arbitrage a large accumulated proﬁt is not attainable with high probability. There
is the possibility, however, of an investor achieving a small positive proﬁt. The
optimization problem presented here produces a market calibrated hedging strategy
that maximizes the likelihood of a positive accumulated proﬁt.

The second criterion (6.5) reﬂects an investor’s desire to minimize the amount
of single period additional funding needed to rebalance the portfolio over the life of
the option. A negative residual δk(u, d) represents the cash shortfall of the portfolio
value at time k. The largest negative δk(u, d) is the largest shortfall value. Optimiz-
ing this criterion produces a hedging portfolio with minimal expected single period
additional funding.

In (6.6) the residual δk(u, d) represents an economic measure of model error.
Concern for minimizing model risk would motivate weighting equally positive and
negative δk(u, d) residuals. Indiﬀerence to the sign of δk(u, d) can be achieved by
using squared residuals in the risk criterion.

Our ﬁnal criterion (6.7) maximizes the expected accumulated residual, which
reﬂects total net proﬁt from using the dynamic portfolio based on the chosen (u, d).
It was shown in [5] that the expected accumulated proﬁt is asymptotically constant
on contours of constant rational price. We thus anticipate minimal diﬀerences in
the expected accumulated proﬁt at each (u, d) pair on our constant rational price
contours when n is large. For small n, empirical results show it is possible to have
a market contour with non-constant expected accumulated proﬁt.

In summary, our model provides a measure of the economic impact of market
incompleteness by the construction of the residuals δk(u, d). The criteria presented
here can be optimized to determine hedging strategies that mitigate investor risk.

7. Algorithm Implementation and Numerical Results

In this section, we present an implementation of our two-stage algorithm for pro-
ducing an optimal hedging strategy as measured by the risk criteria presented in
section 6.2. Following this is a presentation of illustrative results from applying the
algorithm to real market data.

7.1. Two-stage Algorithm

The choice of an optimal (u, d) pair proceeds in two stages.

• Reduction by market calibration of the population of (u, d) pairs to a contour

given by (6.2) corresponding to the quoted market option price.

• Imposition of a ranking criterion, based on a bootstrap estimated statistic of

the residual sequence.

The numerical procedures to be described are implemented in the R computer

language ([14]). The ﬂow of computation proceeds as follows.

(1) The contour creation function in R is applied to the normalized value surface
given in (6.3). Contours deﬁned by (6.2) with r = 0 are identiﬁed as depicted
in Figure 1. The contour matching the market option price x0 is chosen. The
software typically identiﬁes between 80 and 100 (u, d) pairs on the market cal-
ibrated contour.

(2) Historical daily stock price data is used to create a sequence of daily stock price
jumps. The jumps are separated into groups by day count of successive price
data: next day jumps (e.g. Monday to Tuesday price jump) and weekend jumps
(i.e. Friday to Monday price jump) constitute the majority of jumps. There are
a few single day mid-week holiday jumps and long weekend jumps. A typical
stock price process and jump process are depicted in Figure 2.

(3) Each of the next day and weekend groups are sampled with replacement to
form bootstrap jump sequences (four next-day jumps followed by one weekend
jump, repeated for however many weeks of bootstrap data are needed). Each
jump sequence uniquely determines a stock price sequence. A set of bootstrap
jump and price processes are depicted in Figure 3.

(4) For each (u, d) pair on the chosen contour, the sequence of residuals δk are
computed for each bootstrap stock price sequence. A residual sequence for a
bootstrap sample with 30 days to expiration is shown in Figure 4. The distri-
bution of the corresponding aggregated residual is given in Figure 5.

(5) Each criteria is applied to the bootstrap sample of residual sequences and the

appropriate statistic (expected value or probability) is estimated.

(6) The (u, d) pair with the best criterion value is chosen. This results in four

optimal (u, d) pairs, one for each of the four criteria described previously.

bootstrap samples of the stock price jump process. The market option price data for
a period of 40 days prior to expiration was collected and used in selecting market
calibrated contours (as described in section 7.1) with varying time to expiration.
The market option price n days prior to expiration was used in identifying the
appropriate contour for each of the reported values of n.

Selecting a market calibrated contour produces a set of approximately 80 (u, d)
pairs each corresponding to a potential hedging portfolio. The risk criteria (6.4)
through (6.7) are evaluated for each hedging portfolio and the optimal is chosen.
Table 1 presents results for the Exxon-Mobil option with n = 30 days to expiration.
The algorithm produces a hedging portfolio where the probability of a positive proﬁt
is 1. This is consistent with the theoretical results presented in section 5. When the
sequence of relative stock price jumps ξk fall within the interval (u, d), we are guar-
anteed the local residual proﬁts δk will be positive. The optimal expected shortfall
and expected squared deviation are both essentially zero. For this particular data
the objective values along the contour did not vary dramatically. The advantage of
utilizing the algorithm is seen in the expected shortfall computation where the opti-
mal expected shortfall is approximately 3 times as small as other possible shortfall
values.

Results for the Walmart option are presented in tables 2 through 4. Examining
the results we see that for n = 30 and n = 20 days to expiration, the optimal

(u, d) pair produces with probability 1.0 a small positive aggregated proﬁt. It is
interesting to note that over all (u, d) pairs on the contour, the probability of a
positive aggregated proﬁt ranged from approximately 0.6 to 1.0 when n = 30 and
n = 20 and from approximately 0.3 to 0.99 when n = 7. In other words, an investor
can increase the probability of achieving a small positive proﬁt from 0.3 to 0.99 by
following the hedging strategy produced by the algorithm.

Similar results were seen in comparing the values of the other risk criteria for the
optimal hedging portfolio as compared to other hedging portfolios associated with
(u, d) pairs on the contour. In particular, considering the Walmart data with n = 30
days to expiration, the values for the expected shortfall E(max(−δk(u, d))) ranged
from -0.0548 (see the second column of 2) to approximately -0.4. The shortfall is
more than 7 times as large as the optimal for some hedging portfolios. The values of
the expected squared deviation E((δk(u, d))2) ranged from the minimum of 0.0225 to
a maximum of approximately 0.18 and the expected aggregated proﬁt E(∆n(u, d))
ranged from approximately 0 to 0.3. These results illustrate the value of following
the hedging strategy suggested by the algorithm.

Comparing tables 2 through 4 we see that the optimal objective function value
for most of the risk criteria does not change much as the length of time to expiration

changes with the exception of the expected aggregated proﬁt. The value for n = 30 is
more than 10 times larger than the value for n = 7. The diﬀerence could be explained
by the fact that given more time to expiration, there are more opportunities to
withdraw a small positive proﬁt (at each k = 1, 2, · · · , 30). If we consider the results
produced for the Intel option for n = 30, n = 20 and n = 10 presented in tables 5
through 7, we do not see the same change in the value of the expected aggregated
proﬁt. In this case, however, the probability of achieving a positive proﬁt is more
variable with the length of time to expiration increasing from 0.8 to 0.93 as n
decreases from n = 30 to n = 10. Clearly, the behavior of the optimal objective
values vary with each chosen option.

8. Conclusions

We have developed an algorithm that produces a non-self-ﬁnancing hedging strat-
egy in an incomplete market corresponding to one of several investor risk criteria.
The algorithm provides the opportunity to evaluate the economic consequences of
choosing a particular hedging strategy in an incomplete market. The two-stage al-
gorithm optimizes one of a number of investor-relevant statistical properties of a

The algorithm was tested on several options traded on the New York stock
exchange. The results illustrate that following the portfolio strategy produced by
the algorithm is beneﬁcial to an investor, improving the value of the investor risk
criterion by as much as a factor of ten compared to the results associated with
other, non-optimal hedging portfolio strategies.

9. Future Research

In this paper we investigate non-self ﬁnancing hedging strategies for a short-term
European call option (time to expiration, n, is at most 30 days). Our algorithm
builds a short-term portfolio strategy that optimizes one of the investor-related
criteria. Our research was inspired by theoretical investigations of A. Nagaev et
al. (see [5], [6], [7], [8]) where the long-term behavior (large n) of the accumulated
residual (5.3) has been studied.

In [5], [6], and [7], asymptotic properties of the so-called riskless proﬁt of an
investor (∆n(U, D) deﬁned in (3.9) with the boundary parameters U and D) have
been studied. The case of independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) stock price
jumps is presented in [5]; in [6] the jumps are assumed to follow a discrete Markov
chain; [7] studies the case of independent, but not identically distributed jumps. In
all three cases, by means of suitable diﬀusion approximations, asymptotic formulas
for the mean accumulated residuals in terms of the original model parameters have
been obtained.

In [8], A. Nagaev considers the accumulated residual (5.3) for the case of non-
boundary parameters u and d satisfying (4.1) (the so-called risky proﬁt of an in-
vestor). In this case, under the i.i.d. assumptions on the stock price jumps, the
asymptotic formula for the mean accumulated residual has been obtained and
asymptotic connections (as time to expiration n tends to inﬁnity) between E(∆n)
and the set-up cost g0(u, d, s0) have been established.

The present paper is an initial study of the short-term accumulated residuals.
We assume here that the relative stock price jumps are i.i.d. random variables
and build our bootstrap simulation procedure accordingly. In the future we will
investigate the consequences of more realistic assumptions on stock price jumps
using methods of time series analysis and/or advanced model ﬁtting (e.g. Levy
processes based probability models). We also plan to extend our investigations to

other derivative securities with convex pay-oﬀ functions. An additional direction
of future research is numerical testing of the asymptotic formulas obtained by A.
Nagaev et al., more speciﬁcally, exploring the consequences of the ﬁnite number of
time steps to expiration on asymptotic results.
