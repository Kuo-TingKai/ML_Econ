Agent-based Versus Macroscopic Modeling of Competition and

Business Processes in Economics and Finance

Aleksejus Kononovicius, Vygintas Gontis, Valentas Daniunas

June 20, 2012

Abstract

We present examples of agent-based and stochastic models of competition and business processes in
economics and ﬁnance. We start from as simple as possible models, which have microscopic, agent-based,
versions and macroscopic treatment in behavior. Microscopic and macroscopic versions of herding model
proposed by Kirman and Bass new product diﬀusion are considered in this contribution as two basic ideas.
Further we demonstrate that general herding behavior can be considered as a background of nonlinear
stochastic model of ﬁnancial ﬂuctuations.

1 Introduction

Statistically reasonable models of social and economic systems, ﬁrst of all stochastic and agent-based, are of
great interest for a wide scientiﬁc community of interdisciplinary researchers dealing with diversity of complex
systems [1, 2, 3, 4]. Computer modeling is one of the key aspects of modern science, be it physical or social
or economic science, [5, 6]. In case of complex system modeling it serves as a technique in the quest for the
understanding of the interrelation between microscopic interactions of individual agents and macroscopic,
colective, dynamics of the whole complex system. Nevertheless, some general theories or methods that are
well developed in the natural and physical sciences can be helpful in the development of consistent micro and
macro modeling of complex systems [3, 4, 7, 8, 9].

As computer modeling is very prominent and important in modern science, we start this paper by dis-
cussing our online publishing and collaboration platform, see Section 3. The open-source applets made
available online on the website “Physics of Risk”, see [10], allow to reproduce most of the results presented
in this paper. This is very important as reproducibility of the results is one of the key demands in scientiﬁc
society [5, 6].

From the Section 4 we start discussing various models applicable in economics and ﬁnance, which highlight
the important correspondence between microscopic, agent-based, and macroscopic, stochastic, modeling. In
the opening Section 4, we present Kirman’s agent-based model (see [11] for original paper) and derive its
stochastic alternative, which was also done by Alfarano et al. in [12] using a more complex manner. In the
Section 5 we show that modiﬁed, unidirectional, Kirman’s agent based model can be seen as microscopic
alternative to the widely known Bass diﬀusion model [13]. Further, in Section 6, we apply the stochastic
treatment of the Kirman’s model for ﬁnancial markets and obtain stochastic model of absolute return similar
to the CEV process [14] and earlier proposed model of 1/f noise [15, 16, 17].
In the Section 8 we show
that Kirman’s model possesses multifractal features, which are seen as an important feature of many natural
phenomena [18]. Section 9 closes presented discussion with some deﬁnitions and results regarding burst
duration statistics generated by the class of nonlinear SDE and observable in the ﬁnancial markets.

In the last section, Section 10, we sum up everything discussed in this paper and share some ideas on

future developments of the discussed research.

2 Review of the related works

Current on-going ﬁnancial economic crisis provoked many papers calling for a revolution of economical thought
and emphasizing a need for a wider applications of statistical physics in the research of social complexity
[3, 8, 9, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]. Most of them pointing out that agent based models are very important
if one wants to eﬀectively understand what is going on in the complex social and economic systems and the

1

physical intuition might provide the important bridging between the macroscopic and microscopic modeling.
These ideas somewhat traceback to the thoughts put down by Waldrop and Axelrod in the 1990s (see [4, 7]).
In the recent decades there were many attempts to create an agent-based model for the ﬁnancial markets,
yet no model so far is realistic enough and tractable to be considered as an ideal model [26]. One of the
best examples of realistic models is so-called Lux and Marchesi model [27], which is heavily based on the
behavioral economics ideas mathematically put down as utility functions for the agents in the market, thus
it is considered to be very reasonable and realistic [26]. Yet this model is too complex, namely it has many
parameters and complex agent interaction mechanics, to be analytically tractable. Another example of a
very complex agent-based model would be Bornholdt’s spin model [28, 29], which is based on a certain
interpretation of the well-known Ising model (for the details on the original model see any handbook on
statistical physics (ex., [30])).

Some might argue that agent-based models need not to be analytically tractable and in fact that agent-
based models are best suited to model phenomena, which is too complex to be analytically described [31].
But the recent developments show that many groups attempt to build a bridge between microscopic and
macroscopic models. Possibly one of the earliest attempts to do so started from not so realistic, nor tractable
“El Farol bar problem” [32]. This simple model quickly became known as the Minority Game [33] and over
few years received analytic treatment [34]. Another prominent simple agent-based model was created by
Kirman [11], which gained broader attention only very recently [12, 35, 36, 37]. In [38] we have given this
model and extended analytical treatment and have shown that this model coincides with some prominent
macroscopic, namely stochastic, models of the ﬁnancial markets (see Section 7 of this work for more details).
Another interesting development was made by following the aforementioned Bornholdt’s spin model, which
has recently received an analytical treatment via mean-ﬁeld formalism [39].

Our work in the modeling of complex social and economic systems has begun from the applications of
nonlinear stochastic diﬀerential equations (abbr. SDE) seeking reproduce statistics of ﬁnancial market data.
The proposed class of equations has power law statistics evidently very similar to the ones observed in the
empirical data. As all of this work (for broad review see [16]) was done by relying on the macroscopic phe-
nomenological reasoning, we are now motivated to ﬁnd the microscopic reasoning for the proposed equations.
The development of the macroscopic treatments for the well established agent-based models appears to be
the most consistent approach, as the movement in the opposite direction seems to be very complex and
ambiguitious task. Thus we decided that we should select the simple agent-based models, which would have
an expected macroscopic description.
In this contribution we present a few examples of the agent-based
modeling, based on the Kirman’s model, in the business and ﬁnance while showing that the examples have
useful and informative macroscopic treatments.

Kirman’s ant colony model [11] is an agent-based model used to explain the importance of herding inside
the ant colonies and economic systems (see the later works by Kirman (ex. [40]) and other authors, which
develop on this idea, [12, 35]). The analogy can be drawn as human crowd behavior is ideologically and
statistically similar in many senses. On our website, [10], we have presented interactive realizations of the
original Kirman’s agent-based model (see [41]), of its stochastic treatment by Alfarano et al. [12] (see [42])
and of its treatment in the ﬁnancial market scenario done by our group [38] (see [43, 44]).

The diﬀusion of new products is one of the key problems in marketing research, and also one of the ﬁelds
where we see that Kirman’s model might be applied. The Bass diﬀusion model is a very prominent model
related to this problem. This model is formulated as an ordinary diﬀerential equation, which might be used
to forecast the number of adopters of the new successful product or service [13]. There were suggestions
that such basic macroscopic description in marketing research can be studied using the agent-based modeling
as well [45]. Thus it is a great opportunity to explore the correspondence between the micro and macro
descriptions looking for the conditions under which both approaches converge. The Bass Diﬀusion model is
of great interest for us as representing very practical and widely accepted area of business modeling. Web
based interactive models, presented on the site [46] serve as an additional research instrument available for
very wide community. On our website we also provide an interactive applet for the Bass diﬀusion treatment
in terms of the modiﬁed Kirman’s model [47] (for details on modiﬁcation see Section 5 of this work).

Another interesting problem tackled in this work is related to the dynamics of the intermittent behavior.
This kind of behavior is observed in many diﬀerent complex systems ranging from the geology (ex., earth-
quakes [48]) and astronomy (ex., sunspots [49]) to the biology (ex., neuron activity [50]) and ﬁnance [51].
Great review of the universality of the bursty behavior is given by Karsai et al. [52] and Kleinberg [53]. In
[52] the bursting behavior is considered as a point process with threshold mechanism. In this contribution we
analyze the class of nonlinear SDE exhibiting power law statistics and bursting behavior, which was derived

2

from the multiplicative point process [54, 55, 56] with applications for the modeling of trading activity in
ﬁnancial markets [57, 58]. This provides a very general, via hitting time formalism [14, 59, 60], approach to
the modeling of bursty behavior of trading activity and absolute return in the ﬁnancial markets [61].

3 Web platform

Our web site [10] was setup using WordPress webloging software [62]. The setup pays to be user-friendly,
powerful and easily extensible web publishing platform, which with some eﬀort can be adapted to the sci-
entist’s needs. There is a wide choice of plugins, which enable convenient usage of equations (mostly using
LaTeX). While during the setup we found that bibliography management plugins were lacking at the time.
To accommodate our needs for equations we have worked on improving WP-Latex plugin (available from
[63]). Namely we have introduced a possibility to write equations in both inline and ordinary math modes.
Implemented equation labeling, numbering and referencing. And ﬁnally ﬁxed some noticeable problems with
vertical placement of the inline mode equations.

Another important task was to implement bibliography management and citations. For this cause we
have used the bibtexParse PHP code (available from [64]) to setup BiBTeX backend. From this point on we
have written our own original PHP code to link between bibtexParse, our database and WordPress. By using
this plugin we can now easily manage and present our own papers (ex. generate our own bibliographies),
papers we have read (tag them with keywords, write our own comments and etc.) and also communicate
with the visitors using numerous citations.

Interactive models themselves are independent from the publishing framework. Most of them were imple-
mented using the Java applet technology. Some of the applets were created using multi-paradigm simulation
software AnyLogic [65], while the others were programmed from scratch using Java programing language
[66]. AnyLogic was used in the most of agent-based scenarios as it is a very convenient tool for agent-based
modeling, while programing from scratch gave us more control over the applets behavior needed while doing
stochastic modeling.

Either way by compiling appropriate ﬁles one obtains Java applets, which can be included in to the articles
written using WordPress. This way articles become interactive - visitor can both theoretically familiarize
himself with the model and test if the claims made in the post describing model were true. This happens
in the same browser window, thus the transition between theory and modeling appears to be seamless. Due
to the fact that models are implemented as Java applets all of the numerical evaluation occurs on client
machine, while the visitor must have Java Runtime Environment installed, and server load stays minimal.
The requirement for JRE might appear to be cumbersome, but the technology is somewhat popular and
freely available from Oracle Corp.

One of the goals of developing these models on the web site was to provide theoretical background of
Bass Diﬀusion model and discuss practical steps on how such computer simulations can be created even with
limited IT knowledge and further applied for varying purposes (see [46]). Thus, we have targeted small and
medium enterprises to encourage them to use modern computer simulation tools for business planning, sale
forecasting and other purposes.

Consequently computer models and their corresponding descriptions published at the [46] provide a rel-
atively easy starting point to get acquainted with computer simulation in business. The published content
enables site visitors to familiarize themselves with these models interactively, running the applets directly
in a browser window, changing the parameter values and observing results. This signiﬁcantly increases
accessibility and dissemination of these simulations.

Our web site also oﬀers another level of reproducibility by including source code ﬁles inside the Java
applet ﬁles. In this way any willing user may use modern archiver software (ex., 7Zip) to obtain the source
code. After doing so one can analyze source code and more deeply understand the presented models and their
implementations. This is a very important level of reproducibility in the modern scientiﬁc context [5, 6].

4 Extended macroscopic treatment of Kirman’s model

There is an interesting phenomenon concerning behavior of ant colony.
It appears that if there are two
identical food sources nearby, or two identical paths to the same food source (the experiment done by
Pasteels and Deneubourg [67, 68]), ants exploit only one of them at a given time. Evidently the food source

3

which will be used at a given time is not certain. It is so as switches between food sources occur, though the
food sources, or paths, remain the same.

One could assume that those diﬀerent food sources are diﬀerent trading strategies or, if putting it simply,
the actions available to traders. Thus, one could argue that speculative bubbles and crashes in the ﬁnancial
markets are of similar nature as the exploitation of the food sources in ant colonies - as quality of stock and
quality of food in the ideal case can be assumed to be constant. Thus, model [11] was created using ideas
obtained from the ecological experiments [67, 68] can be applied towards the ﬁnancial market modeling.

Kirman, as an economist, actually developed this model as a general framework in context of economic
modeling (see [11, 40] and his other works). Recently his framework was also used by other authors who
are concerned with the ﬁnancial market modeling (see [12, 35]). Thus basing ourselves on the main ideas of
these authors and our previous results in stochastic modeling (see [16]) we introduce speciﬁc modiﬁcations of
Kirman’s model providing a class of nonlinear stochastic diﬀerential equations [17] applicable for the ﬁnancial
variables.

Kirman’s one step transition probabilities might be expressed in the following form [11],

p(X → X + 1) = (N − X) (σ1 + hX) ∆t,
p(X → X − 1) = X (σ2 + h[N − X]) ∆t,

(1)

(2)

where X is a number of agents exploiting the chosen trading strategy (the one used to describe system state),
while N is a total number of agents in the system (thus the other trading strategy is used by the N − X
agents). In the above the original Kirman’s approach was extended by introducing ﬁxed event time scale ∆t
by replacing the original models individual decision εi → σi∆t and herding (1− δ) → h∆t parameters. Later
we will need a more general assumption that parameters σ and h may depend on X and N , but for now we
omit it.

Note that the transition probabilities (1) and (2) describe a scenario where the interaction among agent
groups depends on the overall number of agents in alternative state. Such a choice makes the transition rates
non-extensive, the connectivity between agent groups increases with the number of agents N . The herding
interactions have a global character. Opposite scenario - extensive one will be also used further in this paper.
The lack of memory of the agents is the crucial assumption to formalize the population dynamics as a
Markov process. Furthermore to describe the aforementioned dynamics in a continuous time we will need
to obtain the transition rates, transition probabilities per unit time, which for continuous x = X/N may be
expressed as

(cid:16) σ1

(cid:17)
(cid:17)

π+(x) = (1 − x)
π−(x) = x

(cid:16) σ2

N

N

+ hx
+ h[1 − x]

,

.

(3)

(4)

Here the large number of agents N is assumed to ensure the continuity of variable x, which expresses the frac-
tion of agents using the selected trading strategy, X. Relation between the discrete transition probabilities,
(1) and (2), and continuous transition rates, (3) and (4), should be evident:

p(X → X ± 1) = N 2π±(x)∆t.

(5)

One can compactly express the Master equation for the system state probability density function, ω(x, t),

by using one step operators E and E−1 (see [69] for a details on this formalism) as

∂tω(x, t) = N 2(cid:8)(E − 1)[π−(x)ω(x, t)] + (E−1 − 1)[π+(x)ω(x, t)](cid:9) .

(6)
By expanding E and E−1 using the Taylor expansion (up to the second term) we arrive at the approximation
of the Master equation

∂tω(x, t) = −N ∂x[{π+(x) − π−(x)}ω(x, t)] + 1

x[{π+(x) + π−(x)}ω(x, t)].

2 ∂2

By introducing custom functions

A(x) = N{π+(x) − π−(x)} = σ1(1 − x) − σ2x,
D(x) = π+(x) + π−(x) = 2hx(1 − x) +

behavior dominant model phase (σ1 = σ2 = 16, h = 5). Agent based model results obtained with N = 100.

one can make sure that the (6) is actually a Fokker-Planck equation:

x[D(x)ω(x, t)].

(10)

Note that in the limit of large N one can neglect individual behavior terms in the D(x). The above Fokker-
Planck equation was ﬁrst derived in a slightly diﬀerent manner in the [12].

It is known (for details see [59]) that the Fokker-Planck equation can be rewritten as Langevin equation,

or in other words stochastic diﬀerential equation,

dx = A(x)dt +(cid:112)D(x)dW = [σ1(1 − x) − σ2x]dt +(cid:112)2hx(1 − x)dW,

(11)

here W stands for Wiener process. This step was also present in the [12].

In Fig. 1 we show that the statistical properties obtained from the agent-based model, deﬁned by transition
probabilities (1) and (2), match statistical properties of the solutions of (11). Thus the approximations done
while deriving the Langevin equation for population fraction are valid. Interestingly enough we have obtained
agreement with not so high number of agents - N = 100.

Note that the method used to derive Eq. (11) gives us an opportunity to consider parameters σ1, σ2, h
dependent on the variable x and N . We will need this generalization in the further elaboration on various
applications. From our point of view, the general form of SDE (11) derived from the very basic agent-based
herding model provides a wide choice of opportunities in consistent micro and macro modeling of complex
social systems.

5 Agent based model for the Bass Diﬀusion

The Bass Diﬀusion model is a tool to forecast the diﬀusion rate of new products or technologies [13]. Math-
ematically it is formulated as an ordinary diﬀerential equation

(cid:21)

(12)

where X(t) denotes the number of consumers at time t, N can be seen as the market potential, being a
starting number of the potential consumers (agents), σ is the coeﬃcient of innovation, the likelihood of an
individual to adopt the product due to inﬂuence by the commercials or similar external sources, h is the
coeﬃcient of imitation, a measure of likelihood that an individual will adopt the product due to inﬂuence by
other people who already adopted the product. This nonlinear diﬀerential equation serves as a macroscopic
description of new product adoption by customers widely used in business planning [45].

The agent-based approach to the same problem is related with modeling of product adoption by individual
users, or agents. One can simulate diﬀusion process using computers, where individual decisions of adoption

show that Bass diﬀusion process is a unidirectional case of the Kirman’s herding model [11]. Indeed, let us
deﬁne x(t) in the same way as in previous section x(t) = X(t)/N , then the potential users will adopt the
product at the same rate as in Kirman’s model agents switch from one state to another

(13)

(14)

The form of (14) should be self explanatory - in case of the product diﬀusion agent should not be allow to
withdraw from the consumer state, thus this transition probability should be forced to equal zero.

The mathematical form of (13) is not as evident, note that we have substituted h with h

N (compare with
the original model transition probability (3)), and needs further discussion. Mathematically this substitution
can be backed by the need for the stochastic term to become negligible in the limit of large N . In the modeled
market terms this substitution means an introduction of the interaction locality - namely it is an assumption
that each individual communicates only with his local partners (epidemic case).

One can compare the expression of the transition probability, (13), with the adoption probabilities of the
Linear and GLM models of Bass Diﬀusion discussed in [70]. The match in expressions is clear in the small
time step limit, ∆t → 0.

In case of the transition rates (13) and (14) the macroscopic description functions, namely drift, A(x),

and diﬀusion, D(x), become

A(x) = N π+(x) = (1 − x) (σ + hx) ,

(1 − x)

(15)

D(x) = π+(x) =

(16)
In the large market potential limit, N (cid:29) 1, D(x) becomes negligible and thus one can consider the obtained
equation to be equivalent to the Bass Diﬀusion ordinary diﬀerential equation (12) instead of the stochastic
diﬀerential equation. This serves as a proof that Bass Diﬀusion is an unidirectional epidemic case of Kirman’s
herding model. Though this simple relation looks straightforward, we derive it and conﬁrm by numerical
simulations in fairly original way.

In Figure 2 we demonstrate the correspondence between the Bass Diﬀusion model (macroscopic descrip-
tion) and unidirectional Kirman’s herding model (microscopic description). Both, agent-based and contin-
uous, descriptions of the product adoption, ∆X, converge while the market potential, N , or the selected
observation time interval, τ , become larger.

6 Nonlinear stochastic diﬀerential equation as a model of the ﬁ-

nancial markets

Earlier we have introduced a class of non-linear SDEs providing time series with power-law statistics, and
most notably reproducing 1/f β spectral density, [54, 55, 56]. The general form of the proposed class of Ito
SDEs is

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

dy =

y2η−1dts + yηdWs,

(17)

here y is the stochastic process exhibiting power-law statistics, η is the power-law exponent of the multiplica-
tive noise, while λ deﬁnes the exponent of power-law probability density function (PDF), and W is a Wiener
process (the Brownian motion). Note that SDE (17) is deﬁned in the scaled time, ts = σ2
t is the
t = 1/6 · 10−5s−1 is appropriate in terms of the
scaling parameter. Empirically we have determined that σ2
return model proposed in [71].
From the SDE (17) follows that the stationary probability density function (PDF) of this stochastic
process is power-law, p0(y) ∼ y−λ, with the exponent λ [59]. While in Refs. [72] and later more precisely in
[17] it was shown that the time series obtained while solving SDE (17) have power-law spectral density

Figure 2: Comparison of the product adoption per observation interval, ∆X/τ versus t, obtained from the macroscopic
description by the Bass Diﬀusion model, (12), (red line) and the microscopic description using the unidirectional
Kirman’s model, (13), (blue points). The models tend to converge when time window, τ , or market potential, N ,
become larger: (a) N = 1000, τ = 0.1; (b) N = 1000, τ = 1; (c) N = 10000, τ = 0.1; (d) N = 10000, τ = 1. Other
model parameters were the same for all subﬁgures and were as follows σ = 0.01, h = 0.275.

Power law statistics of the signal y obtained by solving SDE (17) and exponents λ, β are deﬁned for
large y values. Thus one has to introduce the diﬀusion restriction terms in the limit of small y values when
attempting to solve SDE (17) or applying it in a stochastic modeling. There is a wide choice of restriction
mechanisms adjustable to the needs of real systems with negligible inﬂuence on the power law exponents.
We have introduced a term of additive noise while attempting to model the absolute return [71]

such as the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) process or the Constant Elasticity of Variance (CEV) process [14]

, as a less general cases of the SDE (21).

The class of equations based on SDE (17) gives only a general idea how to model power-law statistics
of trading activity and return in the ﬁnancial markets. The problem is to determine the parameter set λ

considers the more sophisticated behavior of the spectral density - power spectral densities have not one,
but two power-law regions with diﬀerent values of β. In the series of papers [71, 72, 58, 57] we have shown
that trading activity and return can be modeled by a more sophisticated version of the SDE than (17) now
including the two powers of the noise multiplicativity. In the case of return instead of Eq. (19) one should
use

here  divides the area of diﬀusion into the two diﬀerent noise multiplicativity regions to ensure the spectral
density of |y| with two power law exponents.

The proposed form of the SDE enables reproduction of the main statistical properties of the return
observed in the ﬁnancial markets. Similarly one can deal with a more sophisticated model for the trading
activity [58]. This provides an approach to the ﬁnancial markets with behavior dependent on the level of
activity and exhibiting two stages: calm and excited. Equation (23) models the stochastic return y with two
power-law statistics, namely the probability density function and the power spectral density, reproducing the
empirical power law exponents of the return in the ﬁnancial markets.

7 Kirman’s model as a microscopic approach to the ﬁnancial mar-

kets

The drawback of the stochastic models is a lack of direct insights into the microscopic nature of replicated
dynamics. Bridging between microscopic and macroscopic approaches is needed for better grounding of
stochastic modeling.

Top-down approach, namely starting from the stochastic modeling and moving towards the agent-based
models, seems to be a very formidable task, as the macro-behavior of complex system can not be understood
as a simple superposition of varying micro-behaviors. While in the case of sophisticated agent-based models
[26] bottom-up approach provides too many opportunities. But there is selection of rather simple agent-based
models (ex. [11]), whose stochastic treatment can be directly obtained from the microscopic description [12].
Here we consider an opportunity to generalize Kirman’s ant colony model [11] with the intention to
modify its microscopic approach to the ﬁnancial market modeling [12] reproducing the main stylized facts of
this complex system. In the Section 4 we have already introduced Kirman’s ant colony model, proposed its
generalization and derived stochastic model for the two state population dynamics.

As Kirman’s model considers the two available agent states one must deﬁne two types of agents acting
inside the market in order to relate Kirman’s model to ﬁnancial markets. Currently, the most common choice
is assuming that agents can be either fundamentalists or noise traders [26].

Fundamentalists are assumed to have the fundamental knowledge about the market, which is assumed to
be quantiﬁed by the so-called fundamental price, Pf (t), of the traded stock. By having this knowledge they
can make long term forecasts on a notion that inﬁnitely long under-evaluation or over-evaluation of the stock
is impossible - the market in some point in the future will have to set a fair price on the stock. Thus their
excess demand, which is shaped by their long term expectations, is given by [12]

Df (t) = Nf (t) ln

Pf (t)
P (t)

,

(24)

here Nf (t) is a number of fundamentalists inside the market and P (t) is a current market price. As long term
investors fundamentalists assume that P (t) will converge towards Pf (t) at least in a long run. Therefore if
Pf (t) > P (t), fundamentalists will expect that P (t) will grow in future and consequently they will buy the
stock (Df (t) > 0). In the opposite case, Pf (t) < P (t), they will expect decrease of P (t) and for this reason
they will sell the stock (Df (t) < 0).

The other group, the noise traders are investors who attempt estimate the stocks future price based on
its recent movements. As there is a wide selection of technical trading strategies, which are used to analyze
stocks price movements, one can simply assume that the average noise traders demand is based on their
mood, ξ(t), [12]

Dc(t) = r0Nc(t)ξ(t),

density, obtained from the stochastic (red and blue curves) and agent-based (green and magenta squares) models.
Two qualitatively diﬀerent model phases are shown: red curve and green squares correspond to herding dominant
model phase (σ1 = σ2 = 0.2, h = 5), while blue curve and magenta squares correspond to individual behavior
dominant model phase (σ1 = σ2 = 16, h = 5). Agent based model results obtained with N = 100.

here Dc(t) is a total excess demand of noise trader group, Nc(t) is a number of noise traders inside the market
and r0 can be seen as a relative noise trader impact factor.

Price and, later after a brief derivation, return can be introduced into the model by applying the Walrassian
scenario. One can assume that trading in the market is cleared instantaneously to set a price, which would
stabilize the market demand for a given moment. Thus the sum of all groups’ excess demands should equal
zero:

Df (t) + Dc(t) = Nf (t) ln

Using Ito formula for variable substitution [59] in SDE (11) we obtain nonlinear SDE for the y(t) = x(t)

dy = (σ1 − y[σ2 − 2h])(1 + y)dt +(cid:112)2hy(1 + y)dW.

(30)

Agreement between the agent-based Kirman’s model applied towards ﬁnancial markets using the ideas dis-
cussed above and the new stochastic model for y, (30), is demonstrated in Fig. 3.

Note once again that the actual derivation, and thus, the ﬁnal outcome, does not change even if σ1, σ2 or h
are the functions of either x or y. Therefore, one can further study the possibilities of the obtained stochastic
model, (30), by checking diﬀerent scenarios of σ1, σ2 or h being functions of either x or y. Nevertheless,
the most natural way is to introduce a custom function τ (y) to adjust the inter-event time according to the

activity based on the return.
We have chosen the case when h and σ2 are functions of y, namely we make the substitutions, σ2 → σ2
τ (y)
and h → h
τ (y) , in the Kirman’s model transition probabilities, (1) and (2), and stochastic model for y, (30).
To further simplify the model we can introduce scaled time, ts = ht, and make related model parameter
transformations, εi = σi

h . By making these substitutions we arrive at

where Ws is appropriately scaled Wiener process. Note that we left σ1, and consequently ε1, independent
of y on purpose as one could argue that individual behavior of fundamentalist trader should not depend on
the observed returns as he is a long term investor uninterested in the momentary ﬂuctuations of the market
mood.

Note that absolute return, y, deﬁned in Eqs.

(30) and (31), serve as a measure of volatility in the
ﬁnancial markets. It is known that volatility has long-range memory and correlates with trading activity
and has probability density function with power law tail [51]. We are particularly interested in the case of
τ (y) = y−α. This selection is deﬁned by the fact that trading activity has positive correlation with volatility
and the class of SDE (17) is invariant regarding power-law variable transformation, see [56]. In such case
the obtained stochastic diﬀerential equation, Eq. (31), in the limit of y (cid:29) 1 is very similar to the stochastic
models discussed in the Section 6.
In the aforementioned limit of y, y (cid:29) 1, we can consider only the highest powers in Eq. (31). In such

case Eq. (31) is reduce to the

dy = (2 − ε2)y2+αdts +

The direct comparison of Eqs. (17) and (32) yields:

(cid:112)

2y3+αdWs.

Consequently we expect that the stochastic process y deﬁned by Eq. (32) will have the power law stationary

similar to the generalized CEV process [14, 73], which was considered in [73],

dy = aydt + byηdW.

In [56] the latter was noted to be a special case of Eq. (21) with exponential restriction of diﬀusion applied.
The comparison with this special case is important on its own as this equation generalizes some stochastic
models used in risk management. Theoretical prediction of PDF and spectral density for y deﬁned by Eq.
(36), is given by [73]

In the Figure 4 we show that the theoretical predictions discussed in this section are valid and that they

enable the reproduction of diﬀerent spectral densities and probability density functions.

set as follows: ε1 = ε2 = 2, α = 0 (red squares), 1 (green squares) and 2 (blue squares).

Note that while the stochastic model based on herding behavior of agents appears to be too crude to
reproduce statistical properties of ﬁnancial markets in such details as the stochastic model driven by the
Eq. (23), which is heavily based on the empirical research, it contains very important long range power
law statistics of the absolute return. Obtained equations are very similar to some general stochastic models
of the ﬁnancial markets [17, 73] and thus, in future development might be able to serve as a microscopic
justiﬁcation for them and maybe for the more sophisticated model driven by the Eq. (23).

It is possible to extend agent-based model by introducing additional agent groups or splitting old ones.
Let us assume that chartist agents may disagree in their expectations and thus divide into pessimists and
optimists. Therefore it is natural to introduce three agent groups (see Fig. 5) interacting among themselves.
Our ﬁrst attempts in this direction proves that in case of the three agent groups (as shown in Fig. 5), when
the herding parameter hcc (cid:29) hcf , might conﬁrm the expectation of a more complex behavior exhibiting
fractured power spectral density of absolute return. More detailed study of such approach in comparison
with macroscopic modeling by SDE (23) is ongoing.

8 Multifractal behavior of return series

In the last few decades it was noted that many natural phenomena have very complex intrinsic structure,
which has a very speciﬁc scaling properties. This notion was generalized as fractal framework [74]. Later
it was also noted that the scaling properties of some processes exhibit even more complex scaling behavior
- namely they appeared to have features of the multiple fractals. Few examples of such phenomena include
geoelectrical processes [75], human heartbeat [76] and gait [77]. The ﬁnancial market time series apparently
are also of the multifractal nature [78, 79, 80].

There are few established methods to detect multifractal time series and two very prominent methods.
One of them is generalized height-height correlation function method (GHHCF) and multifractal detrended
analysis method (MF-DFA). In our previous approaches [81, 38] we have used the GHHCF method, so let us

in this contribution to rely on the MF-DFA method.

To start with the multifractal analysis of the time series, yk, we have to obtain the proﬁle of the time

series, Yk:

Yk =

(yk − (cid:104)y(cid:105)).

k(cid:88)

(40)

j=1

Next we have divide the Yk series into equally sized and non overlapping segments. Thus if our segments are
of the size s, then we will have Ns = int(N/s) segments (here N is the length the series, while int(. . . ) is a
function which takes an integer part of the argument). For the most of the segment sizes some of the data
will be lost, in order to account for it one might want to take another set of segments, but now splitting from
the end of the series.

Further, one has to determine the trends in the obtained segments. Generally this can be done using
varying polynomial ﬁts, but linear ﬁts in the most cases are more than enough. After the trends, ¯Y , are
known one has to evaluate how well the trend ﬁts the actual series:

(cid:2)Y(ν−1)s+i − ¯Yν(i)(cid:3)2

here q stands for generalized coeﬃcient, which is the one enabling us to recover multifractal features it is
also the only diﬀerence from the original detrended ﬂuctuation analysis (DFA) method [18]. Note that in
case of q = 2 the Fq(s) is the same as the one in the original DFA method.

All that is left is to determine is the power law trend, h(q), of the Fq(s). These trends, h(q), are also
frequently named the generalized Hurst exponents. If the Hurst exponents are diﬀerent for diﬀerent q, which
can be any real number, then the signal can be seen as multifractal. In the opposite case or if the variation
is negligible, time series can be assumed as monofractal. For more details on the MF-DFA method see [18].
In Figure 6 we show that the stochastic diﬀerential equations obtained for the modeling of ﬁnancial
markets and derived from the Kirman’s agent-based model have broad multifractal spectra. The curves
capture a region of the Brownian motion, h(q) ≈ 1.5, and a region of long range memory, h(q) ≈ 1. Note
that in case of α = 1 and α = 2 (green and blue curves) h(2) = 1, which can be seen as a proof that the
obtained time series posses the long term correlated (have so-called long range memory) behavior, while for
α = 0 interim behavior between the Brownian motion and long range memory is observed, 1 < h(2) < 1.5.

Figure 7: Time series exhibiting bursty behavior, I(t). Here hI is the threshold value, above which bursts are detected,
ti is the three visible threshold passage events, Imax is the highlighted burst’s peak value. Burst duration we deﬁne
as: T = t2 − t1.

9 Statistics of bursts generated by nonlinear SDE

In the Section 7 we have shown that the herding model of return in the ﬁnancial markets leads to the class of
stochastic diﬀerential equations, whose general form is given by SDE (17). This class of stochastic diﬀerential
equations reproduces power law statistics, namely the probability density function and the spectral density,
of return and trading activity in the ﬁnancial markets. The burst statistics of the ﬁnancial markets are also
very important for the risk management and would serve as an additional criteria to determine the model
consistency. In this section we provide some initial results of burst statistics generated by the SDE (17).

We deﬁne a burst as a part of the time series lying above the certain threshold, hI . In Figure 7 we present
an example burst of the simple bursty time series, I(t). Evidently a burst as itself can be described by its
duration, T = t2 − t1, maximum value, Imax, and burst size, which we deﬁne as an area above the selected
threshold yet bellow time series curve (highlighted by x pattern in the Fig. 7), S.

There is a well established passage, or alternatively hitting, time framework, which is frequently used to
tackle practical problems in both mathematical ﬁnance [14] and physics [59, 60]. One can also apply this
framework to understand the burst durations, T . Interestingly enough we can consider the ﬁrst hitting time
of the stochastic process starting inﬁnitesimally near the hitting threshold as the burst duration itself, T .

Brownian motion, geometric Brownian motion and Bessel process are highly applicable models (for ex-
amples of the application in the mathematical ﬁnance, see [14]) for which hitting times statistics are known.
The Bessel process,

dR =

+ dWs,

(44)

N − 1

2

dts
R

is one of the most interesting as some prominent mathematical ﬁnance models can be transformed to a similar
form. In order to simplify further handling of the Bessel process it is convenient to introduce ν = N
is known as the index of the Bessel process. While N is also frequently retained and mentioned as it bears
an actual physical meaning - the Bessel process is an Euclidean norm, length of the vector, of N -dimensional
Brownian motion, which starts at the origin. Note that for N > 1, or alternatively ν > −0.5, R tends to

2 −1, which

In our case the Bessel process is of high interest as by using the Lamberti transform deﬁned as

(cid:96) : y (cid:55)→ z(y) =

1

(η − 1)yη−1 ,

we can reduce a general class of SDE (17) to the Bessel process,

with index ν = λ−2η+1

η−1 .
Let us assume that a burst starts at time t0, with y0 = y(t0) slightly exceeding the selected threshold,
hy. By deﬁnition the burst lasts until y(t) crosses hy once again, but now from the above. Equivalently,
in the terms of Bessel process the burst lasts until at a certain time, t, the z process crosses the boundary
hz = (cid:96)(hy) from the below, while the starting position, z0 = z(t0), which in the terms of Bessel process is
below the threshold, z0 = (cid:96)(y0) < hz.

Consequently by choosing z0 arbitrarily close yet below hz, we can obtain an estimate for the burst

duration, T , in terms of the hitting times of the Bessel process, τ (ν)

This result is in agreement with a general property of one dimensional diﬀusion processes presented in
[60], namely that the asymptotic behavior of ﬁrst hitting times is a power law t−3/2 irrespectively of the
nature of stochastic one dimensional process or the actual mathematical expressions of the Langevin or the
Fokker-Plank equations. The exponential cutoﬀ for longer burst durations can be explained by the direction
preference of the Bessel processes (note the positive drift term in case of N > 1, or alternatively ν > −0.5).
The actual empirical data, as shown in Fig. 8 (b), also has the predicted asymptotic behavior, though the
inconsistence in ﬁtting is clearly higher than for the model’s probability density Fig. 8 (a).

Our empirical data set includes all trades made on NYSE, which were made from January, 2005 to March,
2007 and involved 24 diﬀerent stocks, ABT, ADM, BMY, C, CVX, DOW, FNM, GE, GM, HD, IBM, JNJ,
JPM, KO, LLY, MMM, MO, MOT, MRK, SLE, PFE, T, WMT, XOM. We have used one hour window
moving average ﬁlter on empirical one minute return series. As we consider the model to be universal, i.e.,
applicable towards the modeling of varying ﬁnancial markets and stocks, we can consider each stocks’ time
series as a separate realization of the same stochastic process. Time series are ﬁrst normalized and later
averaged over the whole set. We back this approach by recalling that in [16] we have shown that the more
sophisticated versions of (23) may be well used to model absolute return of diﬀerent stocks from NYSE and
Vilnius Stock Exchange.

There are numerous reasons for the observed inconsistence in ﬁtting of empirical data Fig. 8 (b). Firstly,
we were unable to remove intra-day pattern from the time series. But the main reason is that the simple
stochastic model, driven by (17), is unable to reproduce the full complexity of empirically observed spectral
density.
In order to reproduce the correct, fractured, shape of the spectral density one must use double
stochastic model, driven by a more sophisticated version SDE (23), [16]. Nevertheless, derived equations for
the burst duration distribution (51) and (52) of the general process (17) are in agreement with empirical time
series of return. This provides one more argument for the further development of stochastic models based on
herding behavior of agents and nonlinear SDE (17).

10 Conclusions and future work

Reasoning of stochastic models of complex systems by the microscopic interactions of agents is still a chal-
lenge for researchers. Only very general models such as Kirman’s herding model in ant colony or Bass
diﬀusion model for new product adoption have well established agent-based versions and can be described
by stochastic or ordinary diﬀerential equations. There are many diﬀerent attempts of microscopic modeling

same empirically deﬁned properties. The ambiguity of microscopic description in complex systems is an ob-
jective obstacle for quantitative modeling. Simple enough agent-based models with established or expected
corresponding macroscopic description are indispensable in modeling of more sophisticated systems. In this
contribution we discussed various extensions and applications of Kirman’s herding model.

First of all, we modify Kirman’s model introducing interevent time τ (y) or trading activity 1/τ (y) as
functions of driving return y. This produces the feedback from macroscopic variables on the rate of micro-
scopic processes and strong nonlinearity in stochastic diﬀerential equations responsible for the long range
power-law statics of ﬁnancial variables. We do expect further development of this approach introducing the
mood of chartists as independent agent-based process.

Nonlinear SDEs derived from the agent herding model generate multifractal time series. This gives
more conﬁdence in the modeling of multifractal series observed in ﬁnancial markets. We derive PDF of
burst duration for the basic form of nonlinear SDE (17). This is in agreement with empirical time series of
return. Further investigation of burst statistics in ﬁnancial markets in comparison with analytical results
from nonlinear SDE is ongoing. This would serve as an independent method to adjust model parameters to
the empirical data.

One more outcome of Kirman’s herding behavior of agents is one direction process - Bass diﬀusion.
This simple example of correspondence between very well established microscopic and macroscopic modeling
becomes valuable for further description of diﬀusion in social systems. Models presented on the interactive web
site [10] have to facilitate further extensive use of computer modeling in economics, business and education.
