Abstract: X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
are two powerful tools to determine the protein 3D structure. However, not all proteins
can be successfully crystallized, particularly for membrane proteins. Although NMR
spectroscopy is indeed very powerful in determining the 3D structures of membrane
proteins, same as X-ray crystallography, it is still very time-consuming and expensive.
Under many circumstances, due to the noncrystalline and insoluble nature of some
proteins, X-ray and NMR cannot be used at all. Computational approaches, however,
allow us to obtain a description of the protein 3D structure at a submicroscopic level.
To the best of the author’s knowledge, there is little structural data available to date
on the AGAAAAGA palindrome in the hydrophobic region (113–120) of prion proteins,
which falls just within the N-terminal unstructured region (1–123) of prion proteins.
Many experimental studies have shown that the AGAAAAGA region has amyloid ﬁbril
forming properties and plays an important role in prion diseases. However, due to the
noncrystalline and insoluble nature of the amyloid ﬁbril, little structural data on the
AGAAAAGA is available. This paper introduces a simple molecular modeling strategy
to address the 3D atomic-resolution structure of prion AGAAAAGA amyloid ﬁbrils.
Atomic-resolution structures of prion AGAAAAGA amyloid ﬁbrils got in this paper
are useful for the drive to ﬁnd treatments for prion diseases in the ﬁeld of medicinal
chemistry.

Introduction

Prion diseases are invariably fatal and highly infectious neurodegenerative diseases af-
fecting humans and animals. The neurodegenerative diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (CJD), variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseases (vCJD), Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker
syndrome (GSS), Fatal Familial Insomnia (FFI), Kuru in humans, scrapie in sheep,

1

bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or mad-cow disease) and chronic wasting dis-
ease (CWD) in cattle belong to prion diseases. By now there have not been some
eﬀective therapeutic approaches or medications to treat all these prion diseases.

Prion diseases are amyloid ﬁbril diseases. The normal cellular prion protein (PrPC)
is rich in α-helices but the infectious prions (PrPSc) are rich in β-sheets amyloid ﬁbrils.
The conversion of PrPC to PrPSc is believed to involve a conformational change from a
predominantly α-helical protein (42% α-helix, 3% β-sheet) to a protein rich in β-sheets
(30% α-helix, 43% β-sheet) [9].

Many experimental studies such as [2, 3, 4, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 18] have shown two
points: (1) the hydrophobic region (113-120) AGAAAAGA of prion proteins is critical
in the conversion from a soluble PrPC into an insoluble PrPSc ﬁbrillar form; and (2)
normal AGAAAAGA is an inhibitor of prion diseases. Furthermore, we computation-
ally clariﬁed that prion AGAAAAGA segment indeed has an amyloid ﬁbril forming
property [20, 21, 22]. However, laboratory experiences have shown that using tra-
ditional experimental methods is very diﬃcult to obtain atomic-resolution structures
of AGAAAAGA due to the noncrystalline and insoluble nature of the amyloid ﬁbril
[16, 23]. By introducing novel mathematical canonical dual formulations and com-
putational approaches, in this paper we may construct atomic-resolution molecular
structures for prion (113-120) AGAAAAGA amyloid ﬁbrils.

Many studies have indicated that computational approaches or introducing novel
mathematical formulations and physical concepts into molecular biology can signiﬁ-
cantly stimulate the development of biological and medical science. Various computer
computational approaches were used to address the problems related to “amyloid ﬁb-
ril” [5, 6, 7, 8, 17, 19]. Here, we would like to use the simulated annealing evolutionary
computations to build the optimal atomic-resolution amyloid ﬁbril models in hopes to
be used for controlling prion diseases.

The atomic structures of all amyloid ﬁbrils revealed steric zippers, with strong van
der Waals (vdw) interactions between β-sheets and hydrogen bonds (HBs) to maintain
the β-strands [15]. The vdw contacts of atoms are described by the Lennard-Jones
(LJ) potential energy:

VLJ (r) = 4εh(

σ

)12 − (

where ε is the depth of the potential well and σ is the atom diameter; these parame-
ters can be ﬁtted to reproduce experimental data or deduced from results of accurate
quantum chemistry calculations. The ( σ
r )6 term
describes attraction. If we introduce the coordinates of the atoms whose number is
denoted by N and let ε = σ = 1 be the reduced units, the form (1) becomes

coordinates of atom i, N ≥ 2. The minimization of LJ potential f (x) on Rn (where
n = 3N) is an optimization problem:

min f (x)

to x ∈ R3N .

Similarly as (1), i.e. the potential energy for the vdw interactions between β-sheets:

VLJ (r) =

the potential energy for the HBs between the β-strands has the formula

VHB(r) =

where A, B, C, D are given constants. Thus, the amyloid ﬁbril molecular modeling
problem is deduced into well solve the optimization problem (3).

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we ﬁrst describe how to build the
prion AGAAAAGA amyloid ﬁbril molecular models, and then explain how the models
with 6 variables only are built and can be solved by any optimization algorithm. At
the end of Section 2 the models are done a little reﬁnement by Amber 11 [1]. At last,
we conclude that when using the time-consuming and costly X-ray crystallography
or NMR spectroscopy we still cannot determine the protein 3D structure, we may
introduce computational approaches or novel mathematical formulations and physical
concepts into molecular biology to study molecular structures. This concluding remark
will be made in the last section.

ular Modeling and Optimizing

Constructions of the AGAAAAGA amyloid ﬁbril molecular structures of prion 113–
120 region are based on the most recently released experimental molecular structures
of human M129 prion peptide 127–132 (PDB entry 3NHC released into Protein Data
Bank (http://www.rcsb.org) on 04-AUG-2010). The atomic-resolution structure of this
peptide is a steric zipper, with strong vdw interactions between β-sheets and HBs to
maintain the β-strands (Figure 1).

In Figure 1 we see that G (H) chains (i.e. β-sheet 2) of 3NHC.pdb can be obtained

from A (B) chains (i.e. β-sheet 1) by

G(H) = 

and other chains can be got by

where I3 is the 3-by-3 identity matrix. Basing on the template 3NHC.pdb from the
Protein Data Bank, three prion AGAAAAGA palindrome amyloid ﬁbril models - an
AAAAGA model (Model 1), a GAAAAG model (Model 2), and an AAAAGA model
(Model 3) - will be successfully constructed in this paper. AB chains of Models 1-3
were respectively got from AB chains of 3NHC.pdb using the mutate module of the
free package Swiss-PdbViewer (SPDBV Version 4.01) (http://spdbv.vital-it.ch).
It is
pleasant to see that almost all the hydrogen bonds are still kept after the mutations;
thus we just need to consider the vdw contacts only. Making mutations for GH chains
of 3NHC.pdb, we can get the GH chains of Models 1-3. However, the vdw contacts
between A chain and G chain, between B chain and H chain are too far at this moment

(Figure 2).

Seeing Figure 2, we may know that for Models 1-3 at least two vdw interactions
between A.ALA3.CB-G.ALA4.CB, B.ALA4.CB-H.ALA3.CB should be maintained.
Fixing the coordinates of A.ALA3.CB and B.ALA4.CB, letting the coordinates of
G.ALA4.CB and H.ALA3.CB be variables, we may get a simple LJ potential energy
minimization problem (3) just with six variables. For solving this six variable opti-
mization problem, any optimization computational algorithm can be used to solve this
low-dimensional problem; for example, in this paper we may use the hybrid discrete
gradient simulated annealing method [22]. Setting the coordinates of G.ALA4.CB
and H.ALA3.CB as initial solutions, running the hybrid discrete gradient simulated
annealing optimization algorithm, for Models 1-3 we get

G(H) = 


1
0

.



By (9) we can get close vdw contacts between A chain and G chain, between B chain
and H chain (Figure 3).

Furthermore, we may employ the Amber 11 package [1] to slightly optimize Models
1-3 and at last get Models 1-3 with stable total potential energies (Figure 4). The
other CDIJ and EFKL chains can be got by parallelizing ABGH chains in the use of
mathematical formulas (7)-(8).

3 Conclusion

X-ray crystallography is a powerful tool to determine the protein 3D structure. How-
ever,
it is time-consuming and expensive, and not all proteins can be successfully
crystallized, particularly for membrane proteins. Although NMR spectroscopy is in-
deed a very powerful tool in determining the 3D structures of membrane proteins, it is
also time-consuming and costly. Due to the noncrystalline and insoluble nature of the
amyloid ﬁbril, little structural data on the prion AGAAAAGA segment is available.
Under these circumstances, the novel simple strategy introduced in this paper can
well do the molecular modeling of prion AGAAAAGA amyloid ﬁbrils. This indicated
that computational approaches or introducing novel mathematical formulations and

5

physical concepts into molecular biology can signiﬁcantly stimulate the development
of biological and medical science. The optimal atomic-resolution structures of prion
AGAAAAGA amyloid ﬁbils presented in this paper are useful for the drive to ﬁnd
treatments for prion diseases in the ﬁeld of medicinal chemistry.
