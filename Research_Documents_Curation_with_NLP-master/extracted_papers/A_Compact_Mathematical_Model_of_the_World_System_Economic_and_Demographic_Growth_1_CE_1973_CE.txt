Abstract 

 

We propose an extremely simple mathematical model that is shown to be able to account for more than 

99 per cent of all the variation in economic and demographic macrodynamics of the world for almost 

two millennia of its history. This appears to suggest a novel approach to the formation of the general 

theory of social macroevolution.  

 

Keywords: economic macrodynamics, demographic macrodynamics, superexponential growth, power-

law behavior, complex systems, finite-time singularity, the World System  

 

Introduction  

 

In 1960 von Foerster, Mora, and Amiot conducted a statistical analysis of the available world popula-

tion data and found out that the general shape of the world population (N) growth is best approximated 

by the curve described by the following equation:  

, 

(1) 

where  C  and  t0  are  constants,  whereas  t0  corresponds  to  an  absolute  limit  of such a trend at  which  N 

would become infinite, and thus logically implies the certainty of the empirical conclusion that further 

ttCN0increases  in  the  growth  trend  will  cease  well  before  that  date,  which  von  Foerster  wryly  called  the 

“doomsday”  implication  of  power-law  growth  –  he  refers  tongue-in-cheek  to  the  estimated  t0  as 

"Doomsday, Friday, 13 November, A.D. 2026" [1]. (Of course, von Foerster and his colleagues did not 

imply  that  the  world  population  on  that  day  could  actually  become  infinite.  The  real  implication  was 

that the world population growth pattern that was followed for many centuries prior to 1960 was about 

to come to an end and be transformed into a radically different pattern. Note that this prediction began 

to be fulfilled only in a few years after the "Doomsday" paper was published, since the 1960 the world 

population growth began to diverge more and more from the blow-up regime, and now it is not hyper-

bolic  any  more  –  see,  e.g.,  Ref.  [2],  where  we  present  a  compact  mathematical  model  that  describes 

both  the  hyperbolic  development  of  the  World  System  in  the  period  prior  to  the  early  1970s,  and  its 

withdrawal from the blow-up regime in the subsequent period).  

Von Foerster, Mora, and Amiot try to account for their empirical observations by modifying the usu-

al starting equations (2) and (3) for population dynamics, so as to describe the process under considera-

tion:  

, 

(2) 

where N is the number of people, B is the number of births, and D is the number of deaths in the unit of 

time;  

 

, 

(3) 

where a1N corresponds to the number of births B, and a2N + bN2 corresponds to the number of deaths 

in equation (2); r, K, a1, a2, b are positive coefficients connected between themselves by the following 

relationships:  

r = a1 – a2      and      

, 

(4) 

They  start  with  the  observations  that  when  individuals  in  a  population  compete  in  a  limited  environ-

ment,  the  growth  rate  typically  decreases  with  the  greater  number  N  in  competition.  This  situation 

would typically apply where sufficient communication is lacking to enable resort to other than a com-

petitive and nearly zero-sum multiperson game. It might not apply, they suppose, when the elements in 

a population “possess a system of communication which enables them to form coalitions” and especial-

 

2 

DBdtdN)()(221bNNaNadtdNKrbly when “all elements  are so strongly linked that the population  as a whole can be considered from a 

game-theoretical point of view as a single person playing a two-person game with nature as the oppo-

nent” [1]. Thus, the larger the population (Nk coalition members, where k < 1) the more the decrease of 

natural risks and the higher the population growth rate. They suggest modeling such a situation through 

the introduction of the nonlinearity in the following form:  

, 

(5) 

where a0 and k are constants, which should be determined experimentally. The analysis of experimental 
data by von Foerster, Mora, and Amiot determines values a0 = 5.5 10-12 and k = 0.99 that produce the 

hyperbolic equation for the world population growth:  

 

which, assuming k = 1.0 [3] is written more shortly as (1) and in equivalent form [4] as (7):  

,  

.

(7) 

Note that if von Foerster, Mora, and Amiot had had at their disposal, in addition to the world popula-

tion data, also the data on the world GDP dynamics for 1–1973 (published, however, only in 2001 by 

Maddison [5]) they could have made another striking "prediction" – that on Saturday, 23 July, 2005 an 

"economic  doomsday"  would  take  place,  that  is  on  that  day  the  world  GDP  would  become  infinite. 

They  would  have  also  found  that  in  1–1973  CE  the  world  GDP  growth  had  followed  quadratic-

hyperbolic rather than simple hyperbolic pattern.  

Indeed, Maddison's estimates of the world GDP dynamics for 1–1973 CE are almost perfectly ap-

proximated by the following equation:  

 

 

,

where G is the world GDP, С = 17355487.3 and t0 = 2005.56 (see Fig. 1):

decided to keep hereafter to the integer year numbers). 

 

In fact, the fit provided by the simple hyperbolic model for the world GDP dynamics for 1–1973 CE is 

also  in  no  way  bad,  but  still  less  perfect  than  the  one  found  for  the  quadratic  hyperbolic  model  (see

This, of course, suggests that the long-term dynamics of the world GDP up to the 1970s should be ap-

proximated better with a quadratic rather than simple hyperbola.  

  Note that, on the other hand, the simple hyperbolic model does fit the world population dynamics in 

1–1973 much better than the world GDP one. Indeed, though the world 1–1973 CE GDP dynamics fits 

the simple hyperbolic model of type (1) rather well (R = .9978, R2 = .9956, p << .0001), this fit is still 

significantly  worse  than  the  one  observed  for  the  world  population  growth  for  the  same  time  (R  =

In this article we show that it is in no way coincidental that the world GDP dynamics in 1–1973 is ap-

proximated so well with a quadratic hyperbola, whereas the world population one does with a simple 

hyperbola. We also suggest a compact explanatory mathematical model describing the world population 

and GDP growth in 1–1973 CE and discuss its implications.  

We believe that the most significant progress towards the development of a compact mathemati-

cal model describing the world GDP growth has been achieved by Michael Kremer [7], whose model 

will be discussed next (for the other mathematical models describing the world hyperbolic growth see 

[3,4,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15];  of  special  interest  are  the  mathematical  models  developed  by  Anders  Jo-

hansen and Didier Sornette [16]; see also [17]; the explanatory logic used by Michael Kremer appears 

to be first suggested by Rein Taagapera [18,19]). 

 

Michael Kremer's model of the world demographic  

and technological growth 

 

One of the basic assumptions of Kremer's model was suggested already in the 18th century by Thomas 

Malthus [20]. It may be worded in the following way:  

 

"Population is limited by the available technology, so that the growth rate of population 

is proportional to the growth rate of technology" [7].  

 

(8) 

The basic model suggested by Kremer assumes that the production output depends on just two factors: 

technological level and population size. Kremer uses the following symbols to denote respective varia-

bles: Y – output, p – population, A – the level of technology, etc.; while describing Kremer's models we 

will  employ  symbols  (closer  to  Kapitza's  ones)  used  in  our  model,  naturally,  without  distorting  the 

sense of Kremer's equations.  

Kremer assumes that overall output produced by the world economy equals 

 

7 

 

2)2065(33505220.7tN1VTNGwhere G is output, T is the level of technology, V is land, 0 < α < 1 is a parameter. Actually Kremer us-

es a variant of the Cobb-Douglas production function. Kremer further qualifies that variable V is nor-

malized to one. The resultant equation for output looks as follows: 

, 

(9) 

where r and α are constants.  

Further Kremer uses statement (8), formulating it in the following way: "In this simplified model 

I  assume  that  population  adjusts  instantaneously  to 

"  [7].  Value 

  in  this  model  corresponds  to 

population  size,  at  which  it produces equilibrium level  of per capita income 

, whereas "population 

increases above some steady state equilibrium level of per capita income, 

, and decreases below it" 

[7].  

Thus, equilibrium level of population 

 equals  

. 

(10) 

Hence, the equation for population size is not actually dynamic. In Kremer's model dynamics is put into 

the equation for technological growth. Kremer uses the following assumption of the Endogenous Tech-

nological Growth theory [21,22,23,24,25,26]:  

"High  population  spurs  technological  change  because  it  increases  the  number  of  potential 

inventors…1. All else equal, each person's chance of inventing something is independent of 

population.  Thus,  in  a  larger  population  there  will  be  proportionally  more  people  lucky  or 

(11) 

smart enough to come up with new ideas"  [7]; thus, "the growth rate of technology is pro-

portional to total population" [7].  

As this supposition, up to our knowledge, was first proposed by Simon Kuznets [21], we shall denote 

the respective type of dynamics as "Kuznetsian", whereas the systems where the "Kuznetsian" popula-

tion-technological dynamics is combined with "Malthusian" demographic one will be denoted as "Mal-

thusian-Kuznetsian".  

This assumption is expressed mathematically by Kremer in the following way:  

                                                           
1 "This implication flows naturally from the nonrivalry of technology… The cost of inventing a new technology is independ-
ent of the number of people who use it. Thus, holding constant the share of resources devoted to research, an increase in 
population leads to an increase in technological change" [7].

(12) 

where b is average innovating productivity per person.  

  Note that this implies that the dynamics of absolute technological  growth  rate can be described by 

the following equation:  

. 

(13) 

  Kremer further combines the research and population determination equations in the following way:  

 

"Since population is limited by technology, the growth rate of population is proportional to the growth 

rate  of  technology.  Since  the growth  rate of technology is  proportional to  the level  of population,  the 

growth rate of population must also be proportional to the level of population. To see this formally, take 

the logarithm of the population determination equation, [(10)], and differentiate with respect to time:  

Substitute in the expression for the growth rate of technology from [(12)], to obtain   

. 

Note that multiplying both parts of equation (14) by N we get

  Thus, Kremer's model produces precisely the same dynamics as the ones of von Foerster and Kapitza 

(and, consequently, it has just the same phenomenal fit with the observed data). However, it also pro-

vides  a  very  convincing  explanation  WHY  throughout  most  of  the  human  history  the  absolute  world 

population  growth  rate tended to  be proportional to N2. Within both models the growth of population 

from, say, 10 million to 100 million will result in the growth of dN/dt 100 times. However, von Foerster 

and Kapitza failed to explain convincingly why dN/dt tended to be proportional to N2. Kremer's model 

explains this in what seems to us a rather convincing way (though Kremer himself does not appear to 

have spelled this out in a sufficiently clear way). The point is that the growth of the world population 

from 10 to 100 million implies that the human technology also grew approximately 10 times (as it turns 

out to be able to support a ten times larger population). On the other hand, the growth of population 10 

times also implies 10-fold growth of the number of potential inventors, and, hence, 10-fold increase in 

the  relative  technological  growth  rate.  Hence,  the  absolute  technological  growth  will  grow  10 x 10 = 

100 times (in accordance to equation (13)). And as N tends to the technologically determined carrying 

capacity ceiling, we have all grounds to expect that dN/dt will also grow just 100 times.  

 

World dynamics as the World System dynamics  

Note that Kremer's model suggests ways to answer one of the main objections raised against the models 

of  the  world  population  hyperbolic  growth.  Indeed,  by  the  moment  the  mathematical  models  of  the 

world population hyperbolic growth have not been accepted by the social science academic community 

(The title of an article by a social scientist discussing Kapitza's model, "Demographic Adventures of a 

Physicist" [27], is rather telling in this respect). We believe there are substantial reasons for such a posi-

tion, and the authors of the respective models are to blame for their rejection to no less extent than so-

cial scientists.  

 

Indeed, all the respective models are based on an assumption that the world population can be treat-

ed  as  an  integrated  system  for  many  centuries,  if  not  millennia  before  1492  (Actually,  von  Foerster, 

Mora, and Amiot [1] detected the hyperbolic growth pattern for 1–1958 CE; however, Kremer [7] sug-

gests  that  it  can  be  traced  up  to  1  million  BCE,  whereas  Kapitza  [4]  insists  that  this  pattern  is  even 

much  more  ancient).  Already,  von  Foerster,  Mora,  and  Amiot  spelled  out  this  assumption  in  a  rather 

explicit way:  

 

10 

gC1"However,  what  may  be  true for  elements  which, because of lack of adequate communication among 
each other, have to resort to a competitive, (almost) zero-sum multiperson game may be false for ele-
ments that possess a system of communication which enables them to form coalitions until all elements 
are so strongly linked that the population as a whole can be considered from a game-theoretical point of 
view as a single person playing a two-person game with nature as its opponent" [1].  

However,  did,  e.g.  in  1–1500  CE,  the  inhabitants  of,  say,  Central  Asia,  Tasmania,  Hawaii,  Terra  del 

Fuego, Kalahari etc. (that is, just the world population) really have such an "adequate communication", 

which made "all elements… so strongly linked that the population as a whole can be considered from a 

game-theoretical  point of view as a single person playing a two-person game with nature as its oppo-

nent"? For any historically minded social scientist the answer to this question is perfectly clear. And, of 

course, this answer is squarely negative. Against this background it is hardly surprising that those social 

scientists  who  managed  to  get  across  the  world  population  hyperbolic  growth  models  had  sufficient 

grounds to treat them just as "demographic adventures of physicists" (note, that indeed seven out of ten 

currently  known  authors  of  such  models  are  just  physicists),  as  none  of  the  respective  authors 

[1,3,4,7,8,9,10,16] has provided any answer to the question above.  

  However, it is not so difficult to provide such an answer.  

The hyperbolic trend observed for the world population growth after 10000 BCE appears to be most-

ly  a  product  of  the  growth  of  the  World  System,  which  seems  to  have  originated  in  the  West  Asia 

around  that  time  in  direct  connection  with  the  Neolithic  Revolution.2  The  presence  of  the  hyperbolic 

trend indicates that the major part of the entity in question had some systemic unity, and the evidence 

for this unity is readily available. Indeed, we have evidence for the systematic spread of major innova-

tions  (domesticated  cereals,  cattle,  sheep,  goats,  horses,  plow,  wheel,  copper,  bronze,  and  later  iron 

technology, and so on) throughout the whole North African – Eurasian Oikumene for a few millennia 

BCE (see, e.g., Ref. [28] for a synthesis of such evidence). As a result the evolution of societies of this 

part of the world already at this time cannot be regarded as truly independent. By the end of the 1st mil-

lennium BCE we observe a belt of cultures stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific with an astonish-

ingly similar level of cultural complexity based on agriculture involving production of wheat and other 

specific  cereals,  cattle,  sheep,  goats,  based  on  plow,  iron  metallurgy,  wheeled  transport,  professional 

armies with  rather similar weapons, cavalries, developed bureaucracies and Axial Age ideologies and 

so on – this list can be extended for pages). A few millennia before we would find a belt of societies 

with a similarly strikingly close level and character of cultural complexity stretching from the Balkans 

                                                           
2  We  are  inclined  to  speak  together  with  Frank  (e.g.,  [31]),  but  not  with  Wallerstein  [32]  about  the  single  World  System, 

which originated long before the "long 16th century".  

 

11 

up to the Indus Valley outskirts – note that in both cases the respective entities included the major part 

of the contemporary world population (see, e.g. [29,30]). We would interpret this as a tangible result of 

the World System functioning. The alternative explanations would involve a sort of miraculous scenar-

io – that the cultures with a strikingly similar levels and character of complexity somehow developed 

independently from each other in a very large but continuous zone, whereas nothing like that appeared 

in the other parts of the world, which were not parts of the World System. We find such an alternative 

explanation highly implausible.  

Thus, we would tend to treat the world population hyperbolic growth pattern as reflecting the growth 

of quite a real entity, the World System.  

  A few other points seem to be relevant here. Of course, there would be no grounds to speak about 

the World System stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific even at the beginning of the 1st Millennium 

CE if we applied the "bulk-good" criterion suggested by Wallerstein [32], as there was no movement of 

bulk goods at all between, say, China and Europe at this time (as we have no grounds not to agree with 

Wallerstein in his classification of the 1st century Chinese silk reaching Europe as a luxury, rather than 

bulk good). However, the 1st century CE (and even the 1st millennium BCE) World System would be 

definitely  qualified  as  such  if  we  apply  a  "softer"  information  network  criterion  suggested  by  Chase-

Dunn and Hall [33]. Note that at our level of analysis the presence of an information network covering 

the whole of World System is a perfectly sufficient condition, which makes it possible to consider this 

system as a single evolving entity. Yes, in the 1st millennium BCE any bulk goods could hardly pene-

trate from the Pacific coast of Eurasia to its Atlantic coast. However, the World System has reached by 

that  time  such  a  level  of  integration  that  the  iron  metallurgy  could  spread  through  the  whole  of  the 

World System within a few centuries.  

Yes,  in  the  millennia  preceding  the  European  colonization  of  Tasmania  its  population  dynamics  – 

oscillating around 4000 level (e.g., [28]) were not influenced by the World System population dynam-

ics and did not influence it at all. However, such facts just suggest that since the 10th millennium BCE 

the dynamics of the world population reflects very closely just the dynamics of the World System popu-

lation (see Refs. [34,35] for more detail).

A compact mathematical model of  

the economic and demographic development of the World System  

 

Though Kremer's model provides a virtual explanation how the World System techno-economic devel-

opment in connection with the demographic dynamics could lead to the hyperbolic population growth, 

Kremer did  not  specify his model to such an extent that  it could also describe the economic develop-

ment of the World System and that such a description could be tested empirically.  

 

In  fact,  it  appears  possible  to  propose  a  very  simple  mathematical  model  describing  both  the  eco-

nomic and demographic development of the World System up to 1973 using the same assumptions as 

the ones employed by Kremer.  

  Kremer's  analysis  suggests  the  following  relationship  between  per  capita  GDP  and  population 

growth rate (see Fig. 5):

ta GDP 

 

Fig. 5. Relationship between per capita GDP and Population Growth Rate according to Kremer [7]  

 
This suggests that for low per capita GDP range the influence of this variable dynamics on the popula-

tion growth can be described with the following equation:  

 

, 

(17) 

where S is surplus, which is produced per person over the amount (m), which is minimally necessary to 

reproduce the population with a zero growth rate in a Malthusian system (thus, S = g – m, where g de-

notes per capita GDP). 

 

13 

aSNdtdNg  Note,  that  this  model  generates  some  predictions, which could  be tested empirically. For example, 

the  model  predicts  that  the  relative  world  population  growth  (

)  should  be  lineally 

proportional to the world per capita surplus production:

The empirical test of this hypothesis has supported it, the respective correlation has turned out to be in 

the predicted direction, very strong (R = .961), and significant beyond any doubt (p = 0.00004) (see Fig. 

6):

S values were calculated on the basis of m estimated as 440 international 1990 dollars in 
purchasing power parity (PPP); for the justification of this estimate see Ref. [41].  
 
The mechanisms of this relationship are perfectly evident. In the range $440–35003 the per capita GDP 

growth  leads  to  very  substantial  improvements  in  nutrition,  health  care,  sanitation  etc.  resulting  in  a 

precipitous decline of death rates (see, e.g., Fig. 7):

Note that during the earliest stages of demographic transition (corresponding just to the range in ques-

tion)  the  decline  of  the  death  rates  is  not  accompanied  by  a  corresponding  decline  of  the  birth  rates 

(e.g., [44]); in fact, they can well even grow (see, e.g., Fig. 9):

Indeed, say the decline of the death rates from, e.g., 50 to 25‰ implies the growth of life expectancies 

from 20 to 40 years, whereas a woman within 40 years can bear much more babies than when she dies 

at  the  age  of  20.  In  many  countries  the  growth  of  the  fertility  rates  in  the  range  in  question  was  also 

connected with the reduction of spacing between births (due to such modernization produced changes 

as the reduction/abolition of postpartum sex taboos, or the reduction of lactation period connected with 

the  growing  availability  of  foods  that  can  serve  as  substitutes  for  maternal  milk).  Against  this  back-

ground the radical decline of the death rates at the earliest stages of demographic transition is accompa-

nied by as a radical increase of the population growth rates.  

  Note that equation (17) is not valid for the GDP per capita range > $3500. In this "post-Malthusian" 

range the death rate reaches bottom levels and then starts slightly growing due to the population aging, 

whereas the growth of such variables as education (and especially female education), level of social se-

curity  subsystem  development,  growing  availability  of  more  and  more  sophisticated  family  planning

further growth of per capita GDP leads not to the increase of the population growth rates, but to their 

substantial decrease (see Fig. 10):

This pattern is even more pronounced for the world countries of 2001, as between 1975 and 2001 the 

number  of  countries  that  had  moved  out  of  the  first  phase  of  demographic  transition  to  the  "post-

 

Malthusian world" substantially increased (see Fig. 11):

way the population growth rates of particular countries, they do not affect the world population growth.

It is also highly remarkable that as soon as the world per capita GDP approached $3000 and exceeded 

this (thus, with S ~ $2500), the positive correlation between S and r first dropped to zero (see Fig. 12):

Thus,  to  describe  the  relationships  between  economic  and  demographic  growth  in  the  "post-

Malthusian" GDP per capita range of > $3000, equation (17) should be modified, which is quite possi-

ble (see, e.g., [2,41]), but which goes out of the scope of this article aimed at the description of econom-

ic and demographic macrodynamics of the "Malthusian" period of the human history.  

  As was already noted by Kremer [7], in conjunction with equation (9) equation of (17) type "in the 

absence of technological change [that is if T = const] reduces to a purely Malthusian system, and pro-

duces behavior similar to the logistic curve biologists use to describe animal populations facing  fixed 

resources"  (actually,  we  would  add  to  Kremer's  biologists  those  social  scientists  who  model  pre-

industrial economic-demographic cycles – see, e.g., Refs. [42,43,44,45,46,47]).  

  Note that with a constant relative technological growth rate (

) within this model 

(combining  eguations  (9)  and  (17))  we  will  have  both  constant  relative  population  growth  rate

the higher value of rT we take, the higher value of constant S we get.

This, of course, suggests that in the growing "Malthusian" systems S could be regarded as a rather sen-

sitive indicator of the speed of technological growth. Indeed, within Malthusian systems in the absence 

of technological growth the demographic growth will lead to S tending to 0, whereas a long-term sys-

tematic production of S will be only possible with systematic technological growth.5  

                                                           
5 It might make sense to stress that it is not coincidental that we are speaking here just about the long-term perspective, as in 
a shorter-term perspective it would be necessary to take into account that within the actual Malthusian systems S was also 
produced  quite  regularly  at  the  recovery  phases  of  pre-Industrial  political-demographic  cycles  (following  political-
demographic  collapses  as  a  result  of  which  the  surviving  population  found  itself  abundantly  provided  with  resources). 
However, after the recovery phases the continuing production of significant amounts of  S (and, hence, the continuing sig-
nificant population growth) was only possible against the background of significant technological growth (see,  e.g., [41]). 
Note also that S produced at the initial (recovery) phases of political-demographic cycles in no way can explain the millen-
nial trend towards the growth of S which was observed for many centuries before most of the world population moved to

Within this model, quite predictably, S can be approximated as krT. On the other hand, within this mod-

el,  by  definition,  rT  is  directly  proportional  to  N. Thus, the model generates an altogether not  so self-

evident  (one  could  say  even  a  bit  unlikely)  prediction  –  that  throughout  the  "Malthusian-Kuznetsian" 

part of the human history the world per capita surplus production must have tended to be directly pro-

portional to the world population size. This hypothesis, of course, deserves to be empirically tested. In 

fact, our tests have supported it.  

  Our test for the whole part of the human history, for which we have empirical estimates for both the 

world  population  and  the  world  GDP  (that  is  for  1–2002  CE)6  has  produced  the  following  results:  

R2  =  0.98,  p  <  10-16,  whereas  for  the  period  with  the  most  pronounced  "Malthusian-Kuznetsian"  dy-

namics (1820–1958) the positive correlation between the two variables is almost perfect (see Fig. 15):

Note that as within a Malthusian-Kuznetsian system S can be approximated as kN, equation (17) may 

be appoximated as dN/dt ~ k1N2, or, of course, as dN/dt ~ N2 / C; thus, Kapitza's equation turns out to be 

 

a by-product of the model under consideration.  

Thus, we arrive at the following:  

Hence,  

S ~ k1rT , 

 

rT = k2N . 

dS/dt ~ krT /dt = k3dN/dt. 

This implies that for the "Malthusian-Kuznetsian" part of human history dS/dt can be approximates as 

k4dN/dt.

spective part of the human history both the economic and demographic World System dynamics may be 

approximated by the following unlikely simple mathematical model:7  

  

, 

, 

(19) 

(20) 

where N is the world population, and S is surplus, which is produced per person with the given level of 

technology  over  the  amount,  which  is  minimally  necessary  to  reproduce  the  population  with  a  zero 

growth rate.  

  The world GDP is computed using the following equation:  

, 

(21) 

where m denotes the amount of per capita GDP, which is minimally necessary to reproduce the popula-

tion with a zero growth rate, and S denotes "surplus" produced per capita over m at the given level of 

the world-system techno-economic development.  

  Note  that  this  model  does  not  contain  any  variables,  for  which  we  do  not  have  empirical  data  (at 

least for 1–1973) and, thus, a full empirical test for this model turns out to be perfectly possible.8  

 

Incidentally, this model implies that the absolute rate of the world population growth (dN/dt) should 

have been roughly proportional to the absolute rate of the increase in the world per capita surplus pro-

duction (dS/dt), and, thus (assuming the value of necessary product to be constant) to the absolute rate 

of  the  world  per  capita  GDP  growth,  with  which  dS/dt  will  be  measured  thereafter.  Note  that  among 

other things this could help us to determine the proportion between coefficients а and b.  

  Thus, if the model suggested by us has some correspondence to  reality, one has grounds to expect 

that in the "Malthusian-Kuznetsian" period of the human history the absolute world population growth 

                                                           
7 Note that this model only describes the Malthusian-Kuznetsian World System in a dynamically balanced  state (when the 
observed world population is in a balanced correspondence with the observed technological level). To describe the situa-
tions with N disproportionally low or high for the given level of technology (and, hence, disproportionally high or low  S) 
one would need, of course, the unapproximated version of the model ((9) – (17) – (13)). Note, that in such cases N will ei-
ther grow, or decline up to the dynamic equilibrium level, after which the developmental trajectory will follow the line de-
scribed by the (19) – (20) model. 

8 This refers particularly to the long-range data on the level of world technological development (T), which do not appear to 

be available till now.

As a result, for the period under consideration it appears possible to simplify the second compact mac-

romodel, leaving in it just one free coefficient:

With our two-equation model we start the simulation in the year 1 CE and do annual iterations with 

difference equations derived from the differential ones:  

Ni+1 = Ni + aSiNi , 

       Si+1 = Si + 0.96aNiSi . 

The world GDP is calculated using equation (21).

estimates of Maddison (2001): N0 = 230.82 (in millions); a = 0.000011383; S0 = 4.225 (in International 

1990 PPP dollars).9  

The outcome of the simulation, presented in Fig. 17 indicates that the compact macromodel in ques-

tion is actually capable of replicating quite reasonably the world GDP estimates of Maddison (2001):

tional dollars (1 – 1973 CE). NOTE: The solid grey curve has been generated by the model; black 
markers correspond to the estimates of world GDP by Maddison [5].  

The correlation between the predicted and observed values for this imitation looks as follows: R > .999; 

R2 = .9986; p << .0001. For the world population these characteristics are also very high: R = 0,996; R2 

= 0,992; α << 0,0001.  

  According both to our model and the observed data up to the early 1970s we deal with the hyperbol-

ic growth of not only the world population (N), but also per capita surplus production (S) (see Fig. 18):  

                                                           
9 The value of S0 was calculated with equation S = G/N – m on the basis of Maddison's (2001) estimates for the year 1 CE. 
He estimates the world population in this year as 230.82 million, the world GDP as $102.536 billion (in 1990 PPP interna-
tional dollars), and hence, the world per capita GDP production as $444.225 Maddison estimates the subsistence level per 
capita annual GDP production as $400 [5]. However, already by 1 CE most population of the world lived in rather complex 
societies, where the population reproduction even at zero level still required considerable production over subsistence level 
to maintain various infrastructures (transportation, legal, security, administrative and other subsystems etc.), without which 
even the simple reproduction of complex societies is impossible almost by definition. Note that the fall of per capita pro-
duction  in complex agrarian societies to subsistence level tended to lead to state breakdowns and demographic collapses 
(see, e.g., [42,43,44,46]). The per capita production to support the above mentioned infrastructures could hardly be lower 
than 10% of the subsistence level – that is close to Maddison's [5] of estimates, which makes it possible to estimate the val-
ue of m as $440, and hence, the value of S0 as $4.225.

Note that even if S had not been growing, remaining constant, the world GDP would have been grow-

ing hyperbolically anyway through the hyperbolic growth  of the world population only. However, the 

hyperbolic growth of S observed during this period of the human history led to the fact that the world 

population growth correlated with the world GDP growth not lineally, but quadratically (see Fig. 19):

the  regression  analysis  we  have  performed  has  shown  here  an  almost  perfect

As a result the overall dynamics of the world GDP up to 1973 was not even hyperbolic, but rather quad-

ratic-hyperbolic, leaving far behind the rather impressive hyperbolic dynamics of the world population 

growth (see Fig. 21):

It  is  fairly difficult  not  to  admit  that at  this diagram the human economic history appears to be rather 

"dull" with the pre-Modern era looking as a period of almost complete economic stagnation, followed 

by the explosive modern economic growth.  In reality the latter just does not  let us discern at  the dia-

gram above the fact that many stretches of the pre-modern economic where characterized by dynamics 

that was comparatively no less dramatic. For example, as soon as we "zoom in" the apparently boringly 

flat stretch of the diagram above up to 800 BCE, we will see the following completely dynamic picture 

(see Fig. 23):

Fig. 23. The World GDP Growth from 25000 BCE up to 800 BCE (in billions of 1990 PPP internation-
al dollars)  
 

This, of course, is accounted for by the difference in scales. During the "iron revolution" the World Sys-

tem economic growth was extremely fast in comparison with all the earlier epochs; however, according 

to  DeLong's  estimates  in  absolute  scale  it  constituted  less  than  $10  billion  a  century.  At  present  the 

world GDP increases by $10 billion at average every three days [37]. As a result, even the period of rel-

atively fast World System economic growth in the age of the "iron revolution" looks like almost hori-

zontal line in comparison with the stretch of the modern economic growth. In other words the impres-

sion of the pre-modern economic stagnation created by Fig. 22 could be regarded as an illusion (in the 

strictest sense of this word) produced just by the quadratic-hyperbolic trend of the world GDP growth 

up to 1973.  

  Note also that we have already mentioned that as has been already shown by von Foerster [1], von 

Hoerner [3] and Kapitza [4] the world population growth before the 1970s is very well approximated 

by the following equation:

  As according to the model under consideration S can be approximated as kN, its long term dynamics 

can be approximated with the following equation:  

 

 

. 

(23) 

Hence,  the  long-term  dynamics  of  the  most  dynamical  part  of  the  world  GDP,  SN,  the  world  surplus 

product, can be approximated as follows:  

 

 

. 

(24) 

As we could see at the beginning of this article, this approximation does work rather well.  

 

Conclusion 

 

Human society is a complex nonequilibrium system that changes and develops constantly. Complexity, 

multivariability, and contradictoriness of social  evolution  lead researchers to a logical conclusion that 

any simplification, reduction, or neglect of the manifolds of factors leads inevitably to multiplication of 

error and to significantly erroneous understanding of processes under study. The view that any simple 

general  laws  are  not  observed  at  all  with  respect  to  social  evolution  has  become  totally  predominant 

within  the  academic  community,  especially  among  those  who  specialize  in  the  Humanities  and  who 

confront directly in their research all the manifolds and unpredictability of social processes. A way to 

approach human society as an extremely complex system is to recognize differences of abstraction and 

time  scale  between  different  levels.  If the main task of scientific analysis is  to  detect  the main acting 

forces so as to discover fundamental laws at a sufficiently coarse scale, abstracting from details and de-

viations from general rules at that level, then understanding at that level may help to identify measura-

 

38 

ttCN0ttkCS0202)(ttkCSNble deviations from these laws in finer detail and faster time scales, not as a reductionism but contrib-

uting  to  measurement  of  deviations  that  are  significant  in  their  own  right  at  finer  and  faster  scales. 

Modern  achievements  in  the  field  of  mathematical  modeling  suggest  that  social  evolution  can  be  de-

scribed with rigorous and sufficiently simple macrolaws.  

As is well known in complexity studies – chaotic dynamics at the microlevel can generate a highly 

deterministic macrolevel behavior [45]. To describe behavior of a few gas molecules in a closed vessel 

we need very complex mathematical models, which will still be unable to predict long-run dynamics of 

such a system due to inevitable irreducible chaotic component. However, the behavior of zillions of gas 

molecules  can  be  described  with  extremely  simple  sets  of  equations,  which  are  capable  of  predicting 

almost perfectly the macrodynamics of all the basic parameters (and just because of chaotic behavior at 

microlevel). Of course, one cannot fail to wonder whether a similar set of regularities is not observed in 

the human world too, whether very simple regularities accounting for extremely high proportions of all 

the macrovariation cannot be found just for the largest possible social system – the World System. 

Indeed, as we could see, the extremely simple mathematical models specified above can account for 

more than 99 per cent of all the variation in economic and demographic macrodynamics of the world 

for almost two millennia of its history.  

In fact, this appears to suggest a novel approach to the formation of the general theory of social mac-

roevolution.  The approach prevalent in  classical  social  evolutionism was based on an apparently self-

evident  assumption  that  evolutionary  regularities  of  simple  systems  are  significantly  simpler  than  the 

ones  characteristic  for  complex  systems.  A  rather  logical  outcome  from  this  almost  self-evident  as-

sumption is that one should study first evolutionary regularities of simple systems and only after under-

standing  them  to  move  to  more  complex  ones.10  One  wonders  if  the  opposite  direction  might  not  be 

more productive – from the study of simple laws of the development of the most complex social system 

to the study of the complex regularities of evolution of simple social systems.  

In general, it can be demonstrated [2,34,35,44] that the hyperbolic pattern of the world's population 

growth  could  be  accounted  for  by  the  nonlinear  second  order  positive  feedback  mechanism  that  was 

shown long ago to generate just the hyperbolic growth, known also as the ‘blow-up regime’ [48]. In our 

case this nonlinear second order positive feedback looks as follows: the more people – the more poten-

                                                           
10  Of  course,  a  major  exception  here  is  constituted  by  the  world-system  approach  (e.g.,  [31,32,33]),  but  the  research  of 
world-system students has by now yielded somehow limited results, to a significant extent because they have not used suf-
ficiently  standard  scientific  methods  implying  that  verbal  constructions  should  be  converted  into  mathematical  models, 
whose predictions are to be tested with available data.

the faster population growth – with more people you also have more potential inventors – hence, faster 

technological growth, and so on (see Fig. 24): 

  

 

Fig. 24. Block scheme of the nonlinear second order positive feedback between technological develop-
ment and demographic growth 

Note  that  the  relationship  between  technological  development  and  demographic  growth  cannot  be  ana-

lyzed through any simple cause-and-effect model, as we observe a true dynamic relationship between the-

se two processes – each of them is both the cause and the effect of the other. Up to the 1970s the hyper-

bolic growth of the world population was accompanied by the quadratic-hyperbolic growth of the world 

GDP, just as is suggested by our model. Note that the hyperbolic growth of the world population and 

the  quadratic-hyperbolic  growth  of  the  world  GDP are also very tightly connected processes, actually 

two sides of the same coin, two dimensions of one process propelled by the nonlinear second order pos-

itive feedback loops between the technological development and demographic growth (see Fig. 25):
