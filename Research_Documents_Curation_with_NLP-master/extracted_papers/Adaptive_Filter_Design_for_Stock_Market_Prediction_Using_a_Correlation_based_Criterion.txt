RESUMO 

 

Este trabalho apresenta uma nova abordagem usando filtragem adaptativa para a predição de ativos 
em bolsas de valores. Os conceitos introduzidos permitem a compreensão deste método e o cálculo 
da previsão correspondente. Este método é aplicado, em um estudo de caso, através da previsão da 
valorização real das ações PETR3 (Petrobrás ON), negociadas no mercado  acionário brasileiro. As 
escolhas de primeira linha para o comprimento da janela e para o número de coeficientes de filtro são 
avaliadas. Isto é feito observando-se a correlação entre o sinal preditor e o curso  real das ações no 
mercado,  em  termos  de  comprimento  da  janela  de  predição  e  os  valores  dos  coeficientes  do  filtro 
adaptativo. Mostra-se que tais preditores adaptativos fornecem, em média, um lucro substancial sobre 
o montante investido.

ABSTRACT 

 

This  paper  presents  a  novel  adaptive-filter  approach  for  predicting  assets  on  the  stock  markets. 
Concepts  are  introduced  here,  which  allow  understanding  this  method  and  computing  of  the 
corresponding  forecast.  This  approach  is  applied,  as  an  example,  through  the  prediction  over  the 
actual valuation of the PETR3 shares (Petrobrás ON) traded in the Brazilian Stock Market. The first-
rate choices of the window length and the number of filter coefficient are evaluated. This is done by 
observing the correlation between the predictor signal and the actual course performed by the market 
in  terms  of  both  the  window  prevision  length  and  filter  coefficient  values.  It  is  shown  that  such 
adaptive predictors furnish, on the average, very substantial profit on the invested amount.

1.  Introduction 
 

Adaptive filter is a device able to perform self-learning, that is, when the time goes, this filter set 
the output in conformity  of the required performance. The main feature of  this filter is the fact that 
they  have  skill  to  modify  its  response  in  real  time  with  the  intent  to  improve  its  performance.  In 
practice, the adaptation algorithm is implemented through two classical methods, gradient method and 
least  square  (LMS  algorithm,  RLS  algorithm).  These  filters  have  many  applications  ranging  from 
filtering, spectral analysis, signal detection and equalization. A wide application area of this tool is in 
the  future  sequences  prevision  through  using  past  sequences  information  (Prediction).  Adaptive 
predictor  has  been  used  in  Linear  Predictive  Code  (LPC),  Adaptive  Differential  Pulse  Code 
Modulation (ADPCM) [Haykin (2009)]. 

Figure  1  shows  a  universal  scheme  for  applying  an  adaptive  filter  in  the  prediction  framework, 
where  k  is  the  iteration  number,  x(k)  is  input  signal,  y(k)  is  the  adaptive  filter  output  what  is  an 
estimate about wanted response d(k), and e(k) is the error signal defined as the difference between the 
wanted response and the filter output, i.e., e(k): = d(k) − y(k).  

RLS  (Recursive  Least-Squares)  adaptive  algorithm  offers  high  performance  and  high  speed  of 

convergence when running in time variant environments.

A  window  observation  is  the  time  period  under  analysis,  of  which  usually  has  a  rectangular  or 
exponential fit. The parameter that controls the fit and duration of the observation window is called 
forgetting factor λ (because it accounts for the memory of the algorithm), 0<<λ<1 and the objective 
function is given by:

This  function  is  convex  in  the  multidimensional  space  w(k),  i.e.,  ξd(k)  has  only  one  global 
minimum  and  no  one  local  minimum.  Therefore,  we  can  achieve  that  point  by  setting  the  ξd(k) 
gradient equals to zero, which results

Figure 2.   Convergence of the coefficients of the adaptive filter running to perform the prediction of the PETR3 (Brazilian stock market). 

This work addresses the application of adaptive filters in an important environment, namely, stock 
market  prediction  [Cowles  (1993),  Antoniou  (2004)].  The  accuracy  of  prediction  markets  was 
investigated in [Berg (2003), Dokko (1989)]. Several tools have been suggested in the analysis of the 
tendency of shares on stock exchanges. The stock market forecasting can be carried out using ARIMA 
[Wang  (1996),  Pai  (2005)]  and  further  time  series  approaches  [LeBaron  (1999)],  neural  networks 
[Lawrence  (1997)],  hidden  Markov  chains  [Turner  (1989),  Hassan  (2007)],  genetic  algorithms 
[Werner  (2002),  Chen  (2001)]  and  fuzzy  sets-based  models  [Östermark  (1996)].  Stochastic  process 
modeling can also be useful for market share forecasting [Mandelbrot (1963)]. Even nonlinear models 
can be applied in the area [Franses (1996)]. Models using auto regressive and moving average (AR 
and ARMA models) are extrapolated from linear difference equations can be applied in the area too 
[Wan (1994)].  

 
2.  Application Adaptive Filter in the Framework of Stock Market Prediction 
 

We intend to investigate the viability of the adaptive filtering as a tool for forecasting on the stock 
exchange.  Application  of  LMS  adaptive  filter  has  already  been  successfully  proposed  for  traffic 
forecasting over wireless networks [Liang (2002)]. Adaptive filtering was used to obtain an estimate 
of the price quotation of shares of Petrobrás traded on the Brazilian stock exchange Bovespa (Bolsa 
de  Valores  de  São  Paulo).  For  purposes  of  this  study  was  chosen  active Bovespa  called 
PETR3 (Petrobrás  ON)  comprising  a  main  driver  of Brazilian  stock  market  by  more  than  15% 
of Bovespa index [WWW (2011)]. 

The type of filter used in implementing the predictor for the active PETR3 was an adaptive FIR 
digital filter with 100 real coefficients. The adaptation algorithm is the RLS with forgetting factor of 
0.98. A  window  of  predictability  of  length  16  days  was  adopted. The  simulation  was  performed  in 
MATLABTM platform [Kamen (1997)] corresponding to the period from 01/03/2000 until 09/23/2009. 
The values of daily prices correspond to the instant of closing the stock exchange. Fig. 2 shows the 
convergence of the coefficients of the adaptive filter running to perform the prediction of the PETR3. 

The  evolution  of  the  filter  coefficients  shown  in  this  figure  clearly  indicates  that  there  is 
convergence in the period around the time of prediction. The abscissa axis here is the number of days 
of  opening  the  stock  exchange  after  the  first  day  considered  in  the  simulation,  i.e.  01/03/2000.  The 
actual  valuation  of  the  share  PETR3  (Petrobrás  ON)  traded  in  the  Brazilian  Stock  Market  through 
adaptive filtering is shown in the solid line of Fig. 3 [WWW (2011)]. 

The forecast derived from the adaptive filter is also shown in the same figure.

a) actual market trend b) guesstimate obtained from adaptive filtering. 

It can be observed that the prediction from the adaptive filtering is in agreement with the actual 
price quotation evolution of Bovespa. In Fig.3-4, the prediction delay of 16 days, which corresponds 
to the prediction window, is clearly observed.  

As an example, we performed the prediction for a specific day, namely, 2,459 overture days after 
1/3/2000. Fig. 4 shows a zoom of the prediction made by the adaptive filter in this period, exhibiting 
further details about the behavior of the predictor.  

 
3.  Performance of the Adaptive Filter for Predicting a Representative Asset of the Bovespa 
 

Let us consider the strategies for investment in the shares PETR3 using prediction provided by the 
adaptive  filter  from  the  moment  2473  (shown  in  Fig.  5).  The  filtering  is  performed  with  the  RLS 
algorithm  using  100  coefficients  and  a  forgetting  factor  λ  =  0.98.  The  estimate trend  of  the  price 
quotation of PETR3 based filtering for a 16 days prediction window is displayed in dotted line of Fig 
5.

Figure 5.   Market behavior of the active PETR3 between 08/18/2009 (2,465) and 09/22/2009 (2,489). a) Prediction according to adaptive 

filtering (dotted), b) Actual market quotation (solid). 

The prediction curve suggests the acquisition of the asset on 09/02/2009 (buying in equities) and 
sell these shares at the moment 17/09/2009 (Sale of shares on the rise). The actual behavior indicated 
the  solid  line  in  Fig.  5  shows  that  the  purchase  would  be  accomplished  with  quote  conducted  with 
37.86 and the sale price 41.05 [WWW (2011)]. If this strategy were adopted, this would allow a profit 
of 8.43% on the invested amount. Although this instance is quite particular, it illustrates the power of 
the  adaptive-filter  based  prediction.  Further  days  randomly  chosen  were  also  investigated,  and  the 
general results have been similar. 

The application presented in this section illustrates the potential of this engineering  technique in 
the  decision  making  on  investment  strategies  to  be  adopted  in  the  stock  market.  The  next  section 
evaluates  the  influence  of  a  few  parameters  of  the  adaptive  filter  in  forecasting  the  quotation  of 
PETR3. The robustness of the estimate produced by the adaptive predictor is also evaluated. 

4.  Adaptive Filter Design and Accuracy Analysis of Predictions 

 

A number of challenges can be devised in the above mentioned scenario. To begin with, it could be 
asked for which type of assets this method performs better. What about the number of coefficients of 
the FIR should be used to improve the performance of the predictor? With respect to the prediction 
window,  is  the  quality  of  prediction  size-dependent?  Has  the  value  of  the  forgetting  factor  some 
influence about the results of the prediction? Some of these inquiries are answered in the sequel. In 
order  to  assess  the  performance  of  the  adaptive  filter  estimation,  the  correlation  was  used  as  a 
similarity  measure  to  investigate  the  goodness  of  fit  between  the  predicted  signal  and  the  actual 
market quotation, within a given prediction window.  

 

Figure 6.   Correlation 3D-plot between the predicted signals obtained from the adaptive filter predictor and the actual market quotation. 

 

The accuracy analysis was then carrying out by investigating the correlation values as a function of 
the number of coefficients of the filter (filter design) and the size of the prediction window. Figure 6 
shows the 3D-correlation plot between 08/18/2009 (2,465) and 09/22/2009 (2,489). 

Figure 6 was converted into a three-dimensional contour chart, which is presented in Fig. 7, where 
it  can  be  realized  the  areas  of  an  increased  correlation  between  the  predictor  signal  and  the  actual 
sequence performed by the market. 

In  order  to  investigate  the  influence  of  the  number  of  coefficients  of  the  FIR  filter  used  in  the 
adaptive predictor, the side profile of three-dimensional surface shown in Fig. 6 was drawn (Fig. 8), 
indicating  the  correlation  peaks  seen  by  an  observer  located  on  the  right  of  the  surface.  It  can  be 
observed  that  the  region  between  30  and  100  coefficients  presents  a  high  correlation.  We  clearly 
distinguish that less than 30 FIR coefficients are not enough to get a fine prediction.

Figure 8.    Correlation profile in terms of the number of coefficients of the adaptive filter. This helps in the design of a suitable predictor 

for the Brazilian Stock Market (PETR3) by adaptive filtering. 

The initial  region  exhibiting  very  high  correlation is not useful because it  can  only  be achieved 
with a very small prediction  window. The  first-rate choice of the number of coefficients should  be 
between 60 and 100 in this particular scenario. 

Now, to evaluate the influence of length of the prediction window in the quality of the predictor, 
the front profile of the three-dimensional surface shown in Fig. 6 was drawn in Fig. 9. It shows the 
behavior  of  the  maximum  correlation  in  terms  of  window  size.  Clearly,  the  choice  of  a  very  short 
window  leads  to  a  high  correlation  (indeed,  share  quotations  between  successive  days  show  a  high 
correlation). But this is not of great significance in an investment strategy.  

Surprisingly  it  appears that a choice of length of the window prediction around 10 days  is quite 
inefficient.  In  contrast,  prediction  with  a  window  of  about  15-working  days  seems  to  be  quite 
appropriate. Coincidentally, the length selected in the application shown in Section 3 was appropriate.

Additionally,  note  also  that  a  too  long  prediction  window  results  in  a  lower  correlation,  as  was 
expected. So, in this case, a margin of choice for the moment of prediction exists (typically between 
15 and 20 days of opening) in order to achieve better results for the predictor. 

Regarding to the sensibility  of the  prediction outcome, a more meticulous examination  was then 
carried out and its results are listed in Table I. By varying the number N of FIR filter coefficients and 
the length L of the window prediction, we derived the profits shown in the last column of the table. 
The dates for the purchase and sale of the shares suggested by the algorithm (PD and SD, respectively) 
are also included. Assuming that an investor uses this strategy, its actual profit could be calculated by 
means of the historical series of quotations regarding this asset. The purchase and sale actual values of 
assets are indicated (PV and SV, respectively) as well as the corresponding actual profit that would be 
achieved in the “real world”. Indeed, no one knows in advance the value of stock prices of assets in 
the days suggested by the action strategy of the algorithm (for buying and selling assets). However, 
the average earnings are always around 7% in the selected range of filter parameters, corroborating the 
robustness of the adaptive predictor offered in this paper. Recommended values for the length of the 
filter and the prediction window would be for example, in the vicinity of 80 and 16, respectively. 

Both the length of the filter as the suggested window length was acceptable. Actually, FIR filters 
with less than 100 coefficients are not prohibitive complexity and are perfectly feasible. Moreover, a 
prediction horizon of less than a month is quite suitable for applications in the stock market.  

 

5.  Concluding Remarks 

 

The  adaptive  filtering  has  attracted  much  attention,  challenges  and  variety  of  possible 
applications.  This  paper  investigates  the  application  of  adaptive  filters  in  stock  market  prediction. 
Adaptive filtering was used to generate a forecast on the price quotation of Petrobrás shares traded on 
the  Brazilian  stock  exchange,  which  is  the  main  driver  of  Brazilian  stock  market.  The  actual 
valuation of the PETR3 share (Petrobrás ON) traded in the Brazilian Stock Market through adaptive 
filtering was investigated.  It was shown that this approach furnishes on the average very substantial 
profit on the invested amount. The performance of the adaptive filter estimation was assessed, and a 
correlation measure was used to investigate the goodness of fit between the predicted signal and the 
actual market quotation. The influence of both the window length and number of coefficients of the 
FIR  filter  in  the  quality  of  the  predictor  were  examined.  It  is  fairly  clear  that  the  estimated  profit 
(8.43%) on this investment strategy does not stand for a general behavior of the method, since it is 
merely  a  punctual  estimation.  Nevertheless,  it  suggests  that  the  technique  can  provide  high  profits 
and also furnishes an order of magnitude of profits.  A random selection of a large number of periods 
of investment (while buying and selling of shares) should be made. A deeper statistical study is being 

conducted to shed light on the potential of the technique. Therefore, this paper offers new predictors 
based  on  adaptive  filtering  as  a  decision  making  engineering  tool  on  investment  strategies  to  be 
adopted in the stock market. The results are very promising, requiring, nevertheless, a more careful 
evaluation. Nevertheless they unveiled a new set of applications of predictive filtering in the field of 
Economics.
