Abstract
Behavioral Finance has become a challenge to the scientiﬁc community. Based on the assumption that behavioral
aspects of investors may explain some features of the Stock Market, we propose an agent based model to study
quantitatively this relationship.
In order to approximate the simulated market to the complexity of real markets,
we consider that the investors are connected among them through a small world network; each one has its own
psychological proﬁle (Imitation, Anti-Imitation, Random); two diﬀerent strategies for decision making: one of them
is based on the trust neighborhood of the investor and the other one considers a technical analysis, the momentum
of the market index technique. We analyze the market index ﬂuctuations, the wealth distribution of the investors
according to their psychological proﬁles and the rate of return distribution. Moreover, we analyze the inﬂuence of
changing the psychological proﬁle of the hub of the network and report interesting results which show how and when
anti-imitation becomes the most proﬁtable strategy for investment. Besides this, an intriguing asymmetry of the return
rate distribution is explained considering the behavioral aspect of the investors. This asymmetry is quite robust being
observed even when a completely diﬀerent algorithm to calculate the decision making of the investors was applied to
it, a remarkable result which, up to our knowledge, has never been reported before.

1. Introduction

In the last decades many researchers have devoted their studies to understand the ﬁnancial market expecting that it
behaves as a complex system. Diﬀerent branches of the science started researching how the behavior of the investors
work in real systems as an attempting to understand it as a whole [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. In particular,
we have the Economic system which works as a complex system, where people, companies and markets are at the
microscopic level trying to increase their proﬁts predicting the behavior of the investors [14, 15, 16, 17]. We already
know that many situations aﬀect the stock market such as the value of the index which depends on the choice of the
investors to either buy, sell or hold their stocks. If this decision of the investors is based only on the behavior of their
trust network, psychological tendencies arise from various processes [18]. Then, the trust neighborhood and also the
market index behavior are driving forces in order to inﬂuence the decision making of the investors.

Financial Market (FM) is the place where the ﬁnancial assets are traded 1. There are some economic functions
provided by the FM which show how the ﬁnance is related to the economy system. The three major functions are: the
interactions among buyers and sellers which determine the price of the traded asset, which means that they determine
the required return on a ﬁnancial asset; liquidity which is a mechanism that FM provides to investors to sell their
ﬁnancial assets and it can distinguish diﬀerent kinds of markets (liquidity degree); and the last one is related to

reducing the search costs of transactions (the money spent to advertise the one’s intention to sell or purchase a ﬁnancial
asset) and information costs (assessing the investment merits of a ﬁnancial asset: the amount and the likelihood of
the cash ﬂow to be generated). The participants of the FM can be households, business entities, national government
agencies, supranational (World Bank, European Investment Bank) etc [19].

Stock market has a large number of interacting agents making decisions all the time [3, 20, 11, 12]. Many re-
searchers are trying to study its behavior based on the similarity with a complex system. It has no central controller
and the dynamic observed from it brings some patterns which are hard to predict such as patterns of bubbles and
crashes. These patterns are good examples of the capacity of the market to exhibit a self-organization behavior and
then emergent properties [2, 15, 14].
Duncan J. Watts e Steven Strogatz show that the average distance (cid:104)l(cid:105) between two nodes increases increases
logarithmically with the size of the network. We see that (cid:104)l(cid:105) = ln N [21, 22]. This characteristic can also be seen
in free scale network (SFN). Then, we can infer that most SFN are a kind of small world network (SWN) [23, 22].
Therefore, we can represent our society of investors in the stock market connected through a Scale Free Network as
shown in the Figure 2.

Several researchers from social to computation science have shown that the social networks are scale free. This
complex network has been used as a tool to connect people in the real world [24, 25, 22]. As a consequence, it is
able to describe social interactions and it is very important to the spread of information, playing a central role on
the social relations [22]. In this way, we use this scale free network (SFN) to represent our society of investors in
a ﬁnancial market which makes the most realistic connection among the investors, building their trust neighborhood
[24, 25, 26, 27]. One of the most important characteristics of the SWN is that there is almost always a shortcut
connecting any two nodes. In this situation, there are many alternative routes between any two points, and it is very
likely that some will involve only a few jumps (links). Moreover, a SFN feature is that highly connected nodes have a
greater-than-average chance of being linked to other highly connected nodes creating hubs which are highly connected
among themselvs. Members of a hub trust network might, for instance, share information, quickly synchronizing their
“cluster”, while for the rest of network information percolates slowly by local interactions [24, 28, 29, 22].

An agent based model grounded on behavioral stochastic Cellular Automata (CA) has been implemented in order
to reproduce the main features of the Stock Market and study it as a complex system [30]. However, to approach the
agents to real investors, it was mandatory to consider a technical analysis in the decision making of the agents, feature
which has not been considered in the algorithm yet. As forecasting price movements is the core of the technical
analysis, this methodology uses past prices,volume and/or open interest in order to bring several kinds of forecasting
techniques such as chart analysis taking into account shapes in bar charts, as gaps, spikes, ﬂags, etc, which tests the
proﬁtability of visual chart patterns, cycle analysis and computerized technical trading systems [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 11].
Technical analysis is widely used among traders and ﬁnancial professionals (i.e. the participants of the FM), and is
very often used by active day traders and market makers [35].

Thus, in this work we improve the original model [30] exploring the decision making algorithm which is now
combining two strategies to help the investor to make an investment. At each time step, the investor will consider his
trust neighborhood and the trend of the stock market index with diﬀerent weights. In order to study the stock market
index tendency, we are going to apply a technical analysis methodology called momentum. This indicator warns about
latent strengths or weaknesses in the tendency by monitoring the price [31, 32, 33]. Yet, it will be taken into account
the psychological behavior of each investor when applying these two strategies. In this way, the investor will take a
decision of either buying, holding or selling stocks based on combination of his trust neighborhood and momentum
technique choices.

Next section, we present the methodology developed to implement the rules through the CA, the Complex Network
and the algorithms to simulate every scenario analyzed. We are going to show how these algorithms work with the
decision-make of the investors. We also discuss the role of the hub of the system (SFN) over the wealth distribution.
Eventually, we will present some results from our simulation where we explain the eﬀect of both strategies over the
wealth distribution of the investors and their proﬁtable return. In the conclusion section, we state the impressive result
we have obtained when comparing the return rate of the anti-imitators with the imitators one.

2. Methodology

In a previous work [30], we presented a Hybrid Cellular Automata (HCA) model and studied four diﬀerent kinds of
networks (Regular, Random Conservative, Random Non-Conservative and Small World Network) and their inﬂuence
in the Stock Market Index oscillations. This Agent-Based Model consists of the HCA which is able to apply a Monte
Carlo process. Each node is as an investor (agent) having a psychological proﬁle (Imitator, Anti-Imitator and Random
Trader), a state (buying, holding, selling) and a number of links (connections). By using a complex network, we
construct the trust neighborhood of the investors which is given by the connections that each of them has through the
SFN. The states and psychological proﬁles are placed at random into the trust network.

Being an imitator means that an investor will perform the same state as the majority in his neighborhood. Anti-
Imitator proﬁle means that an investor will perform the same state as the minority of his neighborhood. Random
Trader proﬁle means that an investor will take his decision randomly.

Thus, by setting up this new algorithm, we are going to give the system a dynamic process where all the investors
still keep their psychological behavior, but they will not necessarily rely on their trust neighborhood. They are also
going to take into account a technical analysis based on momentum technique [33, 32, 31, 36]. Accordingly, we have
as the ﬁrst strategy (strategy-1) the trust neighborhood and as the second strategy (strategy-2) the technical analysis.
The model is built by setting the trust network of the investors (strategy-1) in order to estabilish an initial time series
(100 time steps). The index experiences a ﬂuctuation due to the dynamics of the system during these ﬁrst 100th time
steps. After that, the algorithm starts performing a technical analysis over the time series which was just constructed.
In this way, from the 101th time step, this new algorithm runs both two strategies.

Since we are using a SFN, we know that there are some nodes without any links.

In this case, these nodes
(investors) are going to behave as stubborn ones when considering the strategy-1 [30]. Therefore, those investors who
do not have any connections might change their states by considering only the technical analysis (strategy-2). We can
see that at every time step all the investors will look at their neighborhood (except the ones who do not have any links)
and will analyze the trend of the index. The HCA, then, will give the rules for choosing a new state considering the
psychological proﬁle of the investors. By doing so, every node (agent) will be updated synchronously. At every time
step we compute the index that was, initially, set to 100 as an initial condition. The algorithm starts running, updating
the index considering the number of buyers and sellers. If there is more buying than selling, the net balance is going
to be positive and it makes the index increase; on the other hand, if there is more selling, the net balance is negative
and it makes the index decrease [30].

The implementation of a particular technical analysis, which is used in real markets to study the trend of the
index, follows the momentum (MOM) technique [31, 33, 36]. The value of the momentum, Mτ(t), will be given by
the following three equations:

M1(t) = I(t − 1) − I(t − 2)
M2(t) = I(t − 2) − I(t − 6)
M3(t) = I(t − 6) − I(t − 11)

(1)

and

I stand for Momentum, Time, Time-Lag and Index, respectively.

where M, t, τ
In our model, this process (MOM) consists of computing the diﬀerence between the value of the index of the three
diﬀerent windows: M1(t), M2(t) and M3(t). We, then, have three diﬀerent measures in a given trading interval (days
- time steps, for instance). From the equation 1, computing Mτ(t), we can assume either positive or negative values,
which can be seen as a expectation of the index of going up or down, respectively. Consequently, the traders expect
an increase of the index for the next time step when Mτ(t) > 0, on the other hand, if Mτ(t) < 0 they expect a decrease.
Based on the technical analysis, the simulations will consider the value of the momentum as being the diﬀerence of
the values of the indices at diﬀerent time-lags (windows).

We can think about the steepness of the slope of the index: As Mτ(t) can assume either negative or positive values,
we measure how positive or negative it is for each given τ. It means that the higher a positive/negative value of the
(Mτ(t)) is the steeper the index becomes. Thus, the value of the Mτ(t) obtained for each time-lag proposed is going to
be used to set a probability weight on the process of buying, holding or selling, as shown on the Table 2. This table
shows several patterns which depends on how steep the slope is, either increasing or decreasing. The probabilities
that have been applied to this process are heuristic weights based on the combination of the three slopes, (τ = 1, 2, 3),
which are going to be interpreted as a trend of the index.

3

Let us consider, for instance, if the slope gets steeper with smaller time-lag, see Figure 1, it is interpreted as the
stock price is getting more expensive. This scenario sounds like the investors should buy stocks, once there is a high
probability that the stock price will increase in the next time step. In this scenario we have set a probability weight of
(1, 0, 0) (although this example is a deterministic decision meaning that every investor will buy stocks) - (Case-1) - for
(buying, holding, selling) respectively, see row 2 on the Tables 1 and 2. Based on this table 2 and applying a Monte
Carlo process, we set a stochastic process in order to determine whether the investor is going to decide to buy, hold or
sell stocks.

Figure 1: Left: Trend of the Index where M1(t) > M2(t) > M3(t) > 0 to which can be applied the probabilities from the 2nd row of the Table 1;
Right: Picture shows how the values of M1(t), M2(t) and M3(t) are computed.

From the neighborhood and technical analysis strategies, an investor can experience either the same decision-make
or diﬀerent one to buy, hold or sell his stocks, see Figure A.14 and Algorithm-1. In order to study the system dy-
namics, we have implemented a stochastic process where we will consider some diﬀerent probabilities from a normal
distribution. It will be set the probability to be: 1%, 5%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 95% and 99% to follow the decision-make
from the trend of the index (MOM). Moreover, it will be taken into account the behavior proﬁle of the investors in
order to follow the decision-make given from the MOM. Considering a scenario where an investor has an imitator
proﬁle, one will perform one’s decision as following: he/she looks at his/her trust neighborhood and then performs
the technical analysis: if one gets from both strategies the same decision-make, one will just follow it. If the strategies
show a diﬀerent decision-make, a stochastic process is set to decide which one will be taken. For example: strategy-
1 (neighborhood) comes up to buy stocks; strategy-2 (technical analysis) comes up to sell stocks, thus the imitator
investor will then have a probability, as those stated before, to decide if he is going to be inﬂuenced by the external
factors (technical analysis) or by his neighborhood (trust network).

An interesting scenario occurs when an investor has an anti-imitator proﬁle: he/she will always take the opposite
decision which comes from the strategy-2. This situation is interesting, because we have to realize which one is the
opposite for holding stocks (buy or sell?), for instance. Then, we set a stochastic process in order to decide which
decision-make he/she is going to make. See Figure A.14 and Algorithm-2, .

Finally, the scenario can be summarized as the following: consider that an investor has an imitator proﬁle and 20
connections. The code shows to him how many investors are buying, holding and selling stocks. Then, at the next
time step, he will make a decision to either buy, hold or sell depending on which the majority of his neighborhood
was performing at that given time. Suppose that: buy=12, sell=7 and hold=1, the strategy-1 tells the investor to buy
at the next time step. On the other hand, if the decision-make from the strategy-2 is the same as the one he already
has, he will then buy stock at the next time step. But, if the strategy-2 gives him a contradictory decision, he will
have a probability to follow the decision-make from the technical analysis. Considering, now, that this investor is an
anti-imitator: if the decision-make from the strategy-2 is the same as the strategy-1, three situations can happen: ﬁrst
one - if both strategies show buy, he will then sell; second one - if they show sell, he will then buy; and the last one
- if they show hold, he will decide between buy or sell. On the other hand, if the decision-make from both strategies

strategy-1 and strategy-2 are respectively: 1) buy-sell: he is going to buy stock; 2)buy-hold or sell-hold: he is going
to decide between buy and sell; 3) hold-buy or hold-sell: he is going to decide between hold and sell or hold and buy,
respectively; 4) sell-buy: he is going to sell stock.

We decided to study the system after getting data from running the case-1, see Table 2, and getting statistical
results which can be seen on the Figures 7 and 11. Those results about the wealth distribution and rate of return made
us to think about: what if we invert the system by changing the probabilities between the imitator and anti-imitator
proﬁles. Then, we created the case-2, see the Table 2. As expected, the system inverted the results, see Figures 7
and 11 for the case-2, surprisingly, these results were not so strong as the case-1. We, then, set up the case-3 which
brings the system to the balance, see Table 2, and once again the results showed, statistically, the same results as we
had from case-1. Finally, we set up the case-4 which is the opposite probabilities of the case-3. We showed only the
results from the simulation of the case-4, see Figure 11. Results from all these cases are discussed in the conclusion
section where we state that the anti-imitator proﬁle has an excellent rate of return and wealth distribution compared
to imitators proﬁle.

2.1. Complex Network
In this section we show the properties of the trust network which connects the investors. We set a matrix whose
size is 63 × 63, where the nodes represent the investors. The Figure 2,below, shows an example of a trust network
with SFN morphology. As expected, it happens to have hubs highly connected which can be realized by exhibiting
the distribution of investors by links, see Figure 2.

In the case of SFN, we consider the BarabsiAlbert algorithm [26, 37] to build it. Basically, the code considers a
preferential attachment of the links in such way that, the greater the number of links of a node (investor), the higher
the probability of a new node to be connected to it: the rich gets richer! Thus, we are able to generate SFN up to N
nodes and 8N links, whose distribution by node follows a power law, N((cid:96)) ∼ (cid:96)γ . The exponent measured, γ ∼ −2.5,
agrees with the expected value for the BarabsiAlbert model for networks of comparable sizes.

We can realize that this trust network (SFN) presents a power law distribution (PLD) explaining such a highly
connected investor that we are calling by hub of the system. In this case the hub has 351 connections followed by
other hubs which have, roughly, less than 125 connections. This behavior is characterized by the PLD.

3. Results

We present in this section some results for the two combined strategies. Firstly, we show the temporal series
analysis of the stock index considering those three cases from the Table 2. Secondly, we are going to consider some
scenarios for these combined strategy-1 and strategy-2 where we are going to dicuss the wealth distribution of the
investors and the rate of return based on the inﬂuence of the hub (investor) in function of his psychological proﬁle.

Figure 2: Left: The graph shows that the most connected hub of the system has 351 connections followed by the one which has 116.. Right: The
Figure shows a low density where the hubs can be seen from inside out following the proportion of its connectivity degree.

3.1. Index Oscillation
In this section we show some results for the Case-2, from Table 2. In the Figure 3 we can verify that the Hurst
Exponent (HE) for this case is H99% = 0.4375 ± 0.001 and H70% = 0.4342 ± 0.002. This means that there are no
tendencies on the measured and it agrees with the eﬃcient market hypothesis. The Cases 1 and 2 show two slopes for
the HE which are going to be explored with another methodology in order to explain their role in this scenario.

Figure 3: The ﬁgures show the index oscillations depending on the probabilities to follow the technical analysis and the speciﬁc case from the
table 2 applied to set the probabilities. We verify the stochastic feature of the model by seeing the characteristic behavior of the stock market index
quantiﬁed by the HE. Left: 99% and Case-2; Right: 70% and Case-2.

3.2. Wealth Distribution

This section presents some results considering diﬀerent probabilities to follow the technical analysis (MOM),
strategy-2. From the Figure 4, we can realize how strong the MOM is by impacting on the decision-make of the
investors. Pictures on the left, middle and right show the hub of the system set to be an imitator, random-trader
and anti-imitator, respectively. It is notorious that, statistically, the three of them present the same results. We can
see that the anti-imitation is the best psychological strategy adopted to work over this scenario as we have µanti =
31878.00±23.35 R2 = 0.99345; µrandom = 19937.00±16.44 R2 = 0.99562; µimit = 7886.00±11.41 R2 = 0.98123.

section, 3.3, for each one of them.

From the Figure 5, we can realize that the anti-imitation still have a better return that the others proﬁles, but
not as good as the previous scenario from Figure 4. Again, it does not matter if the hub of the system change his
psychological proﬁle: the system response is, statistically, the same. Now, we have results from Figure 6 which show
that the wealth distribution of the investors is the same for all of them. So, it does not matter their psychological proﬁle
when setting the probability of 1% to follow the MOM. Simulations from several scenarios with diﬀerent probabilities
to follow the MOM technique have provided us such a remarkable result where all the investors who are anti-imitators
obtained a proﬁtable return by following strictly the MOM. Their richness does depend on the sort of the behavioral
proﬁle. We can see straightaway from the simulations that all the anti-imitators got very rich, not only the hub of the
system, but all the anti-imitators. From Figure 13, we see how the whole system displays the wealth distribution as
we move the probabilities from 1% to 99%. For each probability, we run the system with the hub set to be an imitator
and we then got the average of the wealth from all the imitators in the system. Then, we did the same by setting the
hub to be a random-trader and then an anti-imitator. This Figure 13 gives an exactly idea of how the anti-imitator
proﬁle performing a technical analysis is far more proﬁtable than the others two ones.

As we increase the probability of allowing the investors to consider the strategy-2, we realize how the anti-imitators
get much richer and the imitators get very poor. Statistically, from Figures 5 and 6, they all had the same return, but
by increasing the probability to greater than 50%, it can be seen a huge diﬀerence between wealth distribution of each
psychological proﬁle, see Figure 13. The results which come from the random-traders simulations just conﬁrm what
the literature says [36, 2, 38], therefore, it brings robustness to our model.

Anti-imitator. For all of the three scenarios we can see straightaway that the anti-imitation proﬁle has a remarkable perform over the
stock market. The results for the whole system are: µanti = 31878.00 ± 23.35 R2 = 0.99345; µrandom = 19937.00 ± 16.44 R2 =
0.99562; µimit = 7886.00 ± 11.41 R2 = 0.98123

3.3. Return Distribution

This section presents results about the distribution of the rate of return considering the probabilities set to follow
the technical analysis (MOM). We build a probability density distribution (PDF) computing the value of the stock for
every single trading that the investor performs. We set the algorithm-1 and algorithm-2, see Figure A.14, to cumulate
all the operations over the stock market for all the investors. From the Figure 7 we can see an asymmetry of the rate
of return as a function of the psychological behavior. It shows us the histograms for the rate of return distribution. On
the top-left we can see that the anti-imitator proﬁle has a better return than the others proﬁles. The imitator proﬁle,
middle-left, has the worst one which can be seen by getting negative return. As it was to expect, on the bottom-left,
we see that the random proﬁle has a normal distribution.The remarkable result is this asymmetric distribution between
the anti-imitators and imitators investors. In order to compare with the scenario where we set the probability to follow
the MOM to be 5%, we plotted the Figure 8. We see that there is no impact when choosing a speciﬁc proﬁle, because
they all have a Gaussian distribution.

In order to verify the robustness of this result we considered a diﬀerent algorithm for investor’s decision making.
Instead of comparing between two options from trust network or technical analysis, we include both strategies in a

Left: Hub - Imitator; Center: Hub - Random Trader; Right: Hub -

20134.00 ± 5.49 R2 = 0.99967; µimit = 18963.00 ± 20.64 R2 = 0.98197

Figure 6: Proﬁt of the system as function of the hubs - 1%. Left: Hub - Imitator; Center: Hub - Random Trader; Right: Hub
- Anti-imitator. They all present, statistically, the same results. Therefore, the choice for a speciﬁc psychological proﬁle has
no impact over the stock market.The results for the whole system are: µanti = 20081.95.00 ± 2.50 R2 = 0.9981; µrandom =

single index. For example, if the trust network of a given investors is composed of 10 agents, and 6 are holding (value
+1), 3 holding (0) and 1 selling stocks (-1), the weight of the trust network for the index will be (6 + 0 − 1)/10 = 0.5.
Supposing that technical analysis indicates a set of probabilities of (0.8, 0.1, 0.1) to buy, sell or hold respectively, it
would contribute with 0.8 − 0.1 = 0.7 to that index, obtaining the value 1.2. Thus, this investor will buy stocks, since
the result was larger than one. Otherwise, if the result was smaller than −1, the investor would sell stocks. If the value
was remained between −1 and 1, the investor would sell ( or buy ) stocks with a probability equal to the modulus
of the index, or holding otherwise. The Figure 7 on the right side exhibits the results obtained with this alternative
algorithm, and displays, statistically, same results as we had on the left side. However, the range of the distribution
was considered enlarged,

This asymmetry can be explained as following: when the result from the (MOM) is to buy stocks, all the imitators
follow that decision which makes them spend their money at a high price. As the amount of money is limited, they
hold their stocks when do not have suﬃcient money to buy more stocks. On the other hand, the anti-imitators will sell
their stocks at a high price. As the stock just get either more expensive or cheaper, the quantity of stock does not vanish
at the same rate as the money of the imitator investors. Then, the imitators will have few stocks at a high price and
the anti-imitators will have lots of money in function of the stocks which were sold. The same mechanism happens
when the trend of the index is decreasing and the MOM says to sell. Thus, the imitators sell and the anti-imitators
buy stocks at a price less than they have paid for. Over a period of time we have results from simulation showing that
asymmetric rate of return depending on the behavior of the investors.

CONCLUSION

Analysing the result from Figure 2, we decided to performe a new set of simulations to make this inﬂuence clearer.
We create two copies of a given realization of a scale free network with one third of each behavioral proﬁle. Then,
for one copy, we chose the 300 less connected investors (5 links) to change their proﬁles and compare the evolution
of wealth distribution of each realization. We can observe in Figure 13 that the diﬀerence between the realizations
is marginal (comparing it with the Figure 2). Then, we take again the same two copies and now we changed the
behavioral proﬁle of only one link - the hub - we compared the results for wealth distribution. It is clear that the
inﬂuence of changing only the hub is much stronger than changing those 300 less connected investors (5 links each),
evincing that the hub can alter signiﬁcantly the market.

In this paper we have extended a behavioral ﬁnance model in the stock market in order to study the distribution
of the richness among the investors. In this sense we developed an algorithm to perform a technical analysis. By
combining the two diﬀerent techniques which are the neighborhood with their psychological proﬁle as seen in our
previous work [30] and the table which studies the oscillation of the index for diﬀerent time-lags. This complex
system suggests that when taking a probability greater than 50% to apply the technical analysis, there is a huge
chance of getting richer even though having a risk of getting the least proﬁt which is still not too bad when comparing
it with another probabilities scenarios.

The simulations results have shown us how the behavior of the investors and the technical analysis (MOM) can
bring an asymmetric rate of return where the anti-imitators investors had a proﬁtable wealth comparing with the
imitators ones. Moreover, as much as they tend to follow MOM technique as much as we can see how proﬁtable
anti-imitators investors become. From the Figures 11 and 13, we can clearly see how the anti-imitator improve his
proﬁt along the period of investment. The results from simulations, considering the random-traders investors, just
conﬁrming the results from the literature [36, 2], which make the model robust.

We still need a deeper study of the weight probability given for the slope between the time-lags. Furthermore, we
are considering to extend the amount of the resources, a relative risk aversion and make each investor to buy and sell
from each other instead of trading straight from the stock market.

Appendix A. Algorithm

The Algorithm-1, from Figure A.14, shows how we have set the process of verifying what is the state of the trust
neighborhood, that means, what every single investor is performing (buying, holding, selling) at a current time and, at
the same time, making each investor to perform a technical analysis over the temporal series of the index (MOM). The
Algorithm-2 from A.14 shows how the stochastic process works in order to decide if an investor should eithe follow
the MOM result or his trust neighborhood.

Figure A.14: Left: The algorithm shows the strategy’s results. All the investors who are linked look at their neighborhood. The investors perform a
technical analysis and the value of the index is updated at the same time. Right: Decision-make strategy, this algorithm takes the choices from the
trust neighborhood and the technical analysis and perform a stochstic process to decide which one the invesor will follow.
