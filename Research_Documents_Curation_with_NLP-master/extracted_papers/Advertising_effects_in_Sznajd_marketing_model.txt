Abstract: The traditional Sznajd model, as well as its Ochrombel sim-
pliﬁcation for opinion spreading, are applied to marketing with the help of
advertising. The larger the lattice is the smaller is the amount of advertising
needed to convince the whole market.

Keywords: Econophysics, sociophysics, marketing, advertising

Science models like percolation have been applied to marketing by word-
of-mouth [1] as well as advertising through mass media [2]. The present work
applies the Sznajd model of consensus building [3] (see [4] for a review) to
the same problem. How strong has the advertising to be in order to help one
of two products to win the whole market even though initially this product
is in the minority ?

In the Sznajd model as used here, initially a random fraction p of the sites
of a square lattice are customers of product A, while the remaining fraction
1 − p of customers buy product B. At every iteration (random sequential
updating) two neighbouring A sites convince their six neighbours to become
also A sites. In the Ochrombel simpliﬁcation, one A site suﬃces to convince
its four neighbours [5]. After suﬃciently many iterations in a ﬁnite lattice, all
customers have settled onto one product. In the Sznajd model this product
is the one which initially had a slight majority of customers, i.e. product A
for p > 1/2 and product B for p < 1/2; for the Ochrombel modiﬁcation a
fraction p of lattices end up with only A sites, the others with only B sites.

Figure 1: Number of successes, if advertising is switched on only after t1
iterations, for 8 iterations. The diﬀerent crosses refer to t2 − t1 = 2, 4, 8, 16
and 32, which hardly seems to matter.

Advertising is now included by assuming that at each iteration every site
becomes an A site with probability ǫ. We deﬁne a success as meaning that
all sites buy A, and a failure as meaning that inspite of the advertising all
sites buy B for at least one iteration.

Figure 2: Number of successes in Ochrombel simpliﬁcation with diﬀusion.
From left to right the system size increases.

Diﬀusion makes the model more realistic by assuming [6] that only half
of the sites are occupied; at each iteration each agent (= occupied site)
moves into a randomly selected neighbour site if that neighbour is empty.
(“Diﬀusion” is used here in the physics sense, not in that of Bass marketing
theory [1]).

Feedback takes into account that advertising is diminished for already
successful products. The fraction of A customers is called x, that of B cus-
tomers is y = 1 − x. Then advertising produces an A site no longer with
probability ǫ but with probability

at iteration t.

ǫy(t)/y(t = 0)

Figure 3: Log-log plot of the level of advertising needed to convert half the
failures to successes, versus linear lattice dimension L. The line has the slope
-2.3.

This deﬁnes our advertising model which we now simulate with and with-
out feedback, using the original Sznajd version, the Ochrombel simpliﬁcation,
and for Ochrombel also with diﬀusion. We used 1000 diﬀerent samples for

2

each lattice size L × L, L = 31, 53, 71, 101, 301. The initial fraction of A
agents was always p = 0.4.

For the Sznajd model we found that without advertising nearly all samples
ended with product B. With ǫ ∼ 0.1 and larger, all samples were successes, i.e.
the advertising convinced everybody even though initially only a 40 percent
minority was convinced. Equal numbers of failures and successes were found
for ǫ ∼ 0.04 and 0.025 for L = 31 and 53 (not shown). Thus already a small
fraction of advertising is suﬃcient to change nearly all samples from product
B to product A.

We also simulated “ageing” by having advertising only for t1 < t < t2
Strong advertising ǫ = 0.5 produced nearly always a success for t1 up to
10 and was quite useless for t1 > 100 at L = 31, Fig.1; for larger lattices
the characteristic times are larger. The diﬀerence t2 − t1 ∼ 10 was less
important. In short, if a mass media campaign starts too late, then word-of-
mouth propaganda through the standard Sznajd process has already cornered
the market.

The Ochrombel simpliﬁcation, that already a single site convinces its
neighbours, is numerically much easier since no critical point at p = 1/2
occurs without advertising. Thus far less iterations are needed when failures
and successes are nearly balanced. Without advertising we have 400 A ﬁxed
points and 600 B ﬁxed points, and thus we ask how much advertising is
needed to reduce the number of failures from 600 to 300. Fig.2 includes
diﬀusion and shows that the needed ǫ increases from 0.0001 to 0.001 if L
decreases from 101 to 31; the transition curves all have roughly the same
shape. Without diﬀusion the needed advertising is slightly larger. Fig.3
shows that the needed advertising decreases roughly as 1/L2.3.

Quite similar results are obtained also with feedback (for both Sznajd
and Ochrombel version), i.e. the model’s results are quite robust. Again, the
Ochrombel version requires less advertising than the original Sznajd version.
In summary, the Sznajd model and in particular its Ochrombel simpliﬁ-
cation are suitable to show successes and failures of advertising to convince
a market.
