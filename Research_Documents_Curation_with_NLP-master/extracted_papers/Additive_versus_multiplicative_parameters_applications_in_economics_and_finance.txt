Additive versus multiplicative parameters:

applications in economics and ﬁnance

Helena Jasiulewicz∗†, Wojciech Kordecki‡

December 13, 2016

Abstract

In this paper, we pay our attention to multiplicative parameters
of random variables and their estimators. We study multiplicative
properties of the multiplicative expectation and multiplicative varia-
tion as well as their estimators. For distributions having applications
in ﬁnance and insurance we provide their multiplicative parameters
and their properties. We consider, among others, heavy-tailed dis-
tributions such as lognormal and Pareto distributions, applied to the
modelling of large losses. We discuss multiplicative models, in which
the geometric mean and the geometric standard deviation are more
natural than their arithmetic counterparts. We provide two examples
from the Warsaw Stock Exchange in 1995–2009 and from a bid of 52-
week treasury bills in 1992–2009 in Poland as an illustrative example.

Keywords: Geometric mean; Geometric variance; Lognormal distri-
bution; Pareto distribution; Multiplicative estimators.

Introduction

Two measures frequently used in descriptive statistics are the arithmetic
mean and the standard deviation. The geometric mean is used less often,

while the geometric standard deviation connected with the geometric mean
is used even more rarely.

When is it better to use arithmetic (additive) parameters and when ge-
ometric (multiplicative) ones? A lot of attention has been paid to these
problems in the economic and ﬁnance literature. One of the ﬁrsts papers on
this topic was the article by Latan´e (1959), who introduced the geometric-
mean investment strategy into the ﬁnance and economics literature. Weide,
Peterson and Maier wrote in their paper (1977):

Most of this work has been devoted to the investigation of various prop-
erties of the geometric mean strategy. Among the properties of optimal
geometric-mean portfolios recently discovered are (i) they maximize the prob-
ability of exceeding a given wealth level in a ﬁxed amount of time, (ii) they
minimize the long-run probability of ruin, and (iii) they maximize the ex-
pected growth rate of wealth.

In the paper (Weide et al., 1977), they consider either the computational
problem of ﬁnding the optimal geometric mean portfolio or the question of
the existence of such a portfolio. They analysed both of these problems
under various assumptions about the investor’s opportunity set and the form
of his/her subjective probability distribution of holding period returns.

Let us assume that the gross return R in a single period has a lognormal
distribution. The unknown parameter is a = E (R) = em+σ2/2. To estimate
this parameter one can use the arithmetic mean of gross returns:

R =

1
N

NXi=1

Ri .

It is an unbiased estimator of the parameter a. Another unknown parameter
considered in (Cooper, 1996) is the geometric mean of the gross return b =
EG (R) = em. The parameter b can be estimated as the geometric mean

RG = eln R = exp  1

N

ln Ri! .

NXi=1

calculated. This value is an asymptotically unbiased estimator of b. More-

In (Cooper, 1996; Jacquier et al., 2003, 2005), the expected value E(cid:0)RG(cid:1) is
over, the variance D2(cid:0)RG(cid:1), which tends to zero, is determined. In our paper,

we point out that the quality of the geometric estimator should be examined

2

by the geometric mean and variance, not by their arithmetic counterparts as
in (Cooper, 1996; Jacquier et al., 2003, 2005).

In the paper (Hughson et al., 2006), the authors point out that forecasting
a typical future cumulative return should be more focused on estimating the
median of the future cumulative return than on the median of the expected
cumulative return. Expectation of the cumulative return is always higher
than the median of the cumulative return. The probability distribution of
returns from risky ventures is positively skewed.
It is frequently assumed
that returns have lognormal distributions. For a lognormal distribution, the
median and the geometrical expectation are equal. Another distribution
frequently used in ﬁnance and insurance is the Pareto distribution, in which
the geometric mean is close to the median and far from the arithmetic mean.
Arithmetic and geometric means are somewhat controversial measure-
ments of the past and future investment returns. Critical remarks on this
topic are given in the paper (Missiakoulis et al., 2007). A review of basic
equalities and inequalities in the context of a gross income from the invest-
ment in a discrete time can be found in the article (Cate, 2009).

Properties of various kinds of means can be found in the review paper

(Ostasiewicz and Ostasiewicz, 2000).

In this paper, unlike in the results discussed above, the issue concerning
multiplicative parameters, including a geometric mean, is also extended with
interpretations and applications of multiplicative variance as a measure of
dispersion. Such a measure, as we justify in more detail in the next sections,
is a better and more natural measure of deviation between random variables
and their geometric mean.

The geometric variance is invariant with respect to multiplication by a
constant. From this property it follows that the variance of an economic
quantity given in diﬀerent monetary units is constant, independent of the
choice of the unit. For example, if the monetary unit is $1 or one monetary
unit is $100 then the variance is the same. Moreover, the geometric variance
is a dimensionless measure of variability. For example, it allows to compare
the variability of exchange rates between diﬀerent currencies.

In Section 2.1 we give deﬁnitions and properties of multiplicative pa-
rameters. We discuss multiplicative models, in which the geometric mean
and the geometric standard deviation are more natural than their arithmetic
counterparts. In Section 2.2 we introduce typical distributions for which the
multiplicative parameters are more natural than the additive ones. In Sec-
tion 2.3 we provide estimators of the multiplicative parameters considered

3

in Section 2.1 and their properties. In Section 3 we give real examples of
applications. These examples indicate the real beneﬁts of applying the geo-
metric parameters instead of arithmetic ones in real situations in economics
and ﬁnance.

2 Parameters and models

2.1 Multiplicative parameters and models

Let us deﬁne the multiplicative (geometric) mean by

where Pr (X > 0) = 1. From Jensen’s inequality it is easy to see that

EG (X) = eE(ln X),

(1)

EG (X) ≤ E (X) .

Below we give some obvious properties of the geometric mean. Equa-

tion (1) implies the formula

EG  nYi=1

Xi! =

nYi=1

EG (Xi) ,

(2)

provided multiplicative expectations of random variables Xi exist. In this
formula the random variables Xi may be dependent. Moreover, for every
a > 0

and for every a ∈ R

EG (aX) = aEG (X) ,

EG (X a) = (EG (X))a .

From (3) for a = −1 we obtain

Hence, from (2) and (4) we have

EG(cid:18) 1
EG(cid:18)X

X(cid:19) =
Y (cid:19) =

1

EG (X)

.

EG (X)
EG (Y )

.

4

(3)

(4)

Property 1. If EG (X + Y ) exists then

EG (X + Y ) ≥ EG (X) + EG (Y ) .
Proof. The formula (5) is by deﬁnition equivalent to

eE(ln(X+Y )) ≥ eE(ln(X)) + eE(ln(Y )).

(5)

(6)

Dividing both sides of (6) by eE(ln(X)) we obtain an equivalent inequality

eE(ln(1+Y /X)) ≥ 1 + eE(ln(Y /X)).

Let T = Y /X. Then, it is suﬃcient to prove the inequality

eE(ln(1+T )) ≥ 1 + eE(ln T ).

Let us assume that T is a discrete random variable and Pr (T = xi) = pi.
From the inequality (7.1) from the book (Mitrinovi´c et al., 1993), p. 6, we
obtain, after the substitution f (x) = ln (1 + ex), the inequality

Substituting xi = ln ai we obtain

ln exp  nXi=1
exp  nXi=1

nXi=1
pi ln ai! + 1 ≤ exp  nXi=1

pixi! + 1! ≤

pi ln (exi + 1) .

pi ln (ai + 1)! ,

which completes the proof of (5) for discrete X and Y . For any X and Y
in the inequality (5) we approximate X and Y by discrete random variables.

The square multiplicative divergence between positive t and 1 is deﬁned

by the following conditions:

1. f (t) ≥ 1 and f (1) = 1,

t(cid:19),
2. f (t) = f(cid:18)1

3. f (t) is an increasing function for t ≥ 1.

5

Condition 2 means that for any two positive numbers u or v:

The function

v(cid:17) = f(cid:16) v
f(cid:16)u
u(cid:17) .

f (t) = eln2 t = tln t

(7)

fulﬁls the above conditions and plays the same role for quotients as t2 for
diﬀerences. It means that f (u/v) is a square multiplicative deviation of u/v
from 1.

We will deﬁne the geometric variance as the multiplicative mean of the
square multiplicative deviation of the random variable X from its geometric
mean:

D2

G (X) = EG(cid:18)exp(cid:18)ln2 X

EG (X)(cid:19)(cid:19) = eD2(ln X).

(8)

From deﬁnition (8) we have

D2
G (X) ≥ 1,
D2
G (X) = 1 ⇐⇒ Pr (X = const) = 1.

The multiplicative (geometric) standard deviation is deﬁned by:

Note that if D2
terpart of

G (X) 6= 1 or D2

G (X). A coun-

σG (X) = e√D2(ln X).
G (X) 6= e then σG (x) 6=pD2

σ (X) + σ (Y ) ≥ σ (X + Y )

is given by the equation

σG (X) σG (Y ) ≥ σG (X + Y ) .

(9)

However, one cannot compare D2 (X) and D2
is represented in the same units as X (e.g. in euro or units of weights or sizes)
but σG (X) is dimensionless (may be expressed in percent after multiplying
by 100).

G (X) because σ (X) =pD2 (X)

Apart from function (7) the function

f (t) = e|ln t|

6

(10)

also fulﬁls the above conditions (Saaty and Vargas, 2007). Note, how-
ever, that the function deﬁned by (10) is a multiplicative counterpart of
E|X − EX|, not of the variance D2 (X).
tion (8) implies the formula

Below we give some properties of the multiplicative variance. Equa-

D2

G  nYi=1

Xi! =

nYi=1

D2

G (Xi) ,

(11)

provided multiplicative variances of random variables Xi exist and Xi are
independent. Moreover, for every a > 0

D2

G (aX) = D2

G (X) ,

and for every a ∈ R

D2
σG (X a) = (σG (X))a .

G (X a) =(cid:0)D2

G (X)(cid:1)a2

From (12) for a = −1 we obtain

,

(12)

(13)

Hence, if X and Y are independent then from (11) and (13) we have

G (X) .

D2

G(cid:18) 1
X(cid:19) = D2
G(cid:18)X
Y (cid:19) = D2

D2

G (X) D2

G (Y ) .

The multiplicative variance and standard deviation are quotient measures
of the deviation between a random variable and its multiplicative mean mG =
EG (X), whereas the additive variance and standard deviation are diﬀerence
measures of the deviation between a random variable and its additive mean
m. Since in the additive case it is useful to deﬁne the kth interval of the form

in the multiplicative case we have the counterpart of the form

(m − kσ, m + kσ) ,

G , mGσk

(cid:0)mGσ−k

7

G(cid:1) .

(14)

Let (X, Y ) be a two-dimensional random vector. We will ﬁnd the best
exponential approximation of a random variable Y by a random variable X.
To achieve that we will ﬁnd a multiplicative counterpart of the equation

min
a,b

E (Y − (aX + b))2 = E(cid:16)Y −(cid:16)eaX +eb(cid:17)(cid:17)2

.

The measure of the distance between a random variable Y and the exponen-
tial function of a random variable X of the form eαX+β will be, according to
equation (7), the geometric expectation of the random variable eln2 T , where

T =

eαX+β

Y

.

Note that

EG(cid:16)eln2 T(cid:17) = exp(cid:16)E ln eln2 t(cid:17) = eE(ln2 T) = eE(ln Y −(αX+β))2

.

Instead of minimizing the expression E (Y − (aX + b))2 we will minimise the
expression

EGe(αX+β−ln Y )2

.

Therefore,

min

for

E (ln Y − (αX + β))2 = E(cid:16)ln Y −(cid:16)eαX +eβ(cid:17)(cid:17)2

(15)

(16)

Formulae (15) and (16) imply that the function that is the best approximation
of the random variable Y has the form

y = e eα(x−E(X))EG (Y ) .

(17)

Note that in equation (17) the parameters of the random variable X are
additive whereas the parameters of the random variable Y are multiplicative.

distribution N (0, σ). We will denote its trend by z, where

z = ln f (x) .

An exponential trend is deﬁned by the formula

y = f (x) = eαx+β.

The trend in the multiplicative model is given by

y = ez.

(19)

(20)

(21)

The behaviour of the variable y in the multiplicative model is reﬂected by
its geometric mean.

2.2 Parameters of selected distributions

In this section we will determine multiplicative parameters of distributions
frequently applied to the modelling of a ﬁnance risk. Two heavy-tailed dis-
tributions, namely lognormal and Pareto distributions used to estimate large
losses on ﬁnancial and insurance markets, are especially important.

A random variable X has a lognormal distribution if Y = ln X has a nor-
mal distribution, Y ∼ N (m, σ), EY = m, D2Y = σ2. Then, the expectation
is

E (X) = em+σ2/2

and the variance

Multiplicative parameters are the following:

D2 (X) = e2m+σ2(cid:16)eσ2

− 1(cid:17) .

EG (X) = Me (X) = em = e−σ2/2E (X) ,

9

G (X) = eσ2
,
where the median Me (X) = EG (X) and D2
respectively.

D2

G (X) depend only on m and σ,

The divergence between means E (X) and EG (X) measured by their re-

lationship d is given by

d (σ) =

E (X)
EG (X)

=

em+σ2/2

em = eσ2/2

and increases exponentially with σ2.

In this context, an interesting distribution is the Pareto distribution, with

a cumulative distribution function

FP (x) =(1 −(cid:0) β
x(cid:1)α

0

for x ≥ β,
for x < β,

where α > 0, β > 0.

The additive parameters of the random variable X are:

E (X) =

αβ
α − 1

αβ2

for α > 1 and

for α > 2.

D2 (X) =

(α − 2) (α − 1)2

The multiplicative parameters are:

EG (X) = βe1/α,
G (X) = e1/α2
D2

(22)

(23)

(24)

and exist for any α > 0. The median Me(X) exists for any α and is given by

Since

Me (X) = β21/α < EG (X) .

lim
α→∞

E (X) = lim
α→∞

EG (X) = 1,

for large α we have E (X) ≈ EG (X).

Now we can derive from Section 2.1 the equations for estimators of the mul-
tiplicative parameters and their properties.

Let X1, X2, . . . , Xn be a random sample for a population with cdf F (x).
Let θ be a multiplicative parameter of F (x), e.g. θ = EG (X) or θ = D2
G (X).
Below we formulate the basic properties of the multiplicative estimators of
such parameters.

The statistic Zn = f (X1, . . . , Xn) is a multiplicative unbiased estimator
of θ if EG (Zn) = θ. The Zn is a multiplicative, asymptotically unbiased
estimator of θ if limn→∞ EG (Zn) = θ. The Zn is a multiplicative consistent
estimator of θ if Zn/θ is convergent in probability to 1, denoted as Zn/θ P−→ 1,

i.e.

3 Applications of the multiplicative model

Many applications of the geometric mean in economics can be found in
the papers (Hughson et al., 2006; Jacquier et al., 2003). The future port-
folio of shares in (Jacquier et al., 2003) and the expected gross return
in (Hughson et al., 2006) were estimated by the geometric mean. Cooper
in (1996) provided some interesting considerations on how one can apply the
geometric or the arithmetic mean to the estimation of the discount rate of
planned investments.

However, applications nearly always used the multiplicative mean. Only
in (Saaty and Vargas, 2007) the multiplicative dispersion given by (10) was
applied, but, as it was explained in Section 2.1, that dispersion diﬀers from
our standard deviation.

In insurance and ﬁnance huge losses are modelled by Pareto or lognormal
distributions. Such distributions are positively skewed, so their arithmetic
expected values are very far from their medians. Therefore, the expected
values do not reﬂect the central tendency of these distributions. As we will see
later, geometric means of distributions do not have such defects. Moreover,
it is evident that the dispersion around EGX must be equal to D2
GX, not to
D2X.

Let us only point out that also in other ﬁelds of science, multiplicative
parameters give a better description of some phenomena than additive ones—
see, for example, (Zacharias et al., 2011) and references therein.

In the next sections we provide two examples of applications of multiplica-
tive parameters. Those examples come from the Polish market and concern
the Stock Exchange in Poland.

3.1 Return index rates

Return rates ir100% of indexes WIG20 from the Warsaw Stock Exchange in
the years 1995–2009 are given in Table 1, r = 1995 . . . 2009. The accumula-
tion coeﬃcients ar = 1 + ir are given in the third column.

The total return at the end of 2009 of an investing initial capital p = 1

at the beginning of 1995 (future value FV ) is given by the formula:

FV =

Since aG = 1.0820,

FV = (aG)15 = 3.2656.

Using the arithmetic mean a = 1.1295 instead of the geometric mean we
obtain

FV ′ = (a)15 = 6.2161,

which is a two-time overstated estimation of the quantity FV .

Next, we calculate ˆsG = 1.1600. Using equation (14) we have the kth
interval for aG: (0.9328, 1.2550), (0.8042, 1.4561) and (0.6933, 1.6890) for k =
1, k = 2 and k = 3, respectively.

If we calculate aG = 1.1036 from the 10 years 1995–2004 only, then the
total forecasted return of the capital with the investment of initial capital
p = 1 at the beginning of the year 2005 is equal to 1.6370. The forecast using
the arithmetic mean a = 1.1447 from the years 1995–2004 is equal to 1.9653.
The true value of the total return is equal to 1.2185. Therefore, it is more
precisely estimated by the geometric mean than by the arithmetic mean.

The analogical conclusion can be drawn from determining the present
value PV by the geometric and arithmetic means of the discount factor

16

vr = 1/ar. Namely,

PV = (vG)15 = 0.3062,
PV ′ = (v)15 = 0.6504.

3.2 The mean annual rate of proﬁtability of treasury

bills

A multiplicative model will be used here to describe the annual market rate
with investment for 52-week treasury bills in Poland. The use of a multi-
plicative model can be justiﬁed by the fact that the accumulation of the
capital is yielded by the multiplication, not by the addition, of gross return
from an investment. Let R denote the annual rate for the 52-week treasury
bills and f (t) = abt be an exponential function of trend. Assume that (see
equation (20))

R = abtε,

where the random component ε has a lognormal distribution LN (0, σ).

To estimate the unknown parameters a and b (see equations (28) and
(29)) of the trend function of the annual rate of interest we make use of
the observations of the average proﬁtabilities from weekly bids in the years
1992–2009. In the observed years, there were from 18 to 56 bids per year.
For these particular years, the arithmetic and geometric means as well as the
medians were taken as the means—see Table 2.

Since diﬀerences between them are small, we take as ri the arithmetic

mean from the annual proﬁtabilities of bids in a particular year.

We will test the hypothesis of normality of ln ε using the modiﬁed Jarque–
2, where mi

Bera test. Let n be the sample size, b1/2

is the i-th central moment of the observations mi =P (cj − x)i /n, and x the

sample mean. For testing normality we use the Jarque–Bera test modiﬁed
by Urz´ua (1996) (see also Thadewald and B¨uning (2004)):

For our data, we have m2 = 0.046825093, m3 = −0.003081238, m4 =
0.006135356, and n = 18. Hence, we can calculate that ALM = 0.4062.
The statistic (32) has an asymptotic χ2 distribution. W¨urtz and Katzgraber
(2005), using a Monte Carlo simulation, provide precise quantiles for small
samples. For the size of sample n = 20 and the levels 0.01 and 0.05 they
obtain critical values 18.643 and 6.9317, respectively. Therefore, for such
critical values one can not reject the null hypothesis of normality.

Figure 1: Annual means and their exponential approximations

The geometric (multiplicative) mean rG = 0.1245 was used here to de-
termine the exponential (that is multiplicative) trend of proﬁtability R (see
formula (17)). For comparison, the arithmetic mean amounts to r = 0.1661,
and therefore, since it is signiﬁcantly greater than rG, it overestimates the
long-run returns (see, e.g., (Cooper, 1996) and (Jacquier et al., 2003)).
