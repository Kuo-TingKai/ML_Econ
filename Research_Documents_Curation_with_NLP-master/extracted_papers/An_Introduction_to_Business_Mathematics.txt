Abstract

These lecture notes provide a self-contained introduction to the mathematical methods required in a Bachelor
degree programme in Business, Economics, or Management. In particular, the topics covered comprise real-
valued vector and matrix algebra, systems of linear algebraic equations, Leontief’s stationary input–output
matrix model, linear programming, elementary ﬁnancial mathematics, as well as differential and integral
calculus of real-valued functions of one real variable. A special focus is set on applications in quantitative
economical modelling.

Qualiﬁcation objectives of the module
(excerpt)

The qualiﬁcation objectives shall be reached by an integrative approach.

A broad instructive range is aspired. The students shall acquire a 360 degree orientation concerning
the task- and personnel-related tasks and roles of a manager and supporting tools and methods and
be able to describe the coherence in an integrative way. The knowledge concerning the tasks and
the understanding of methods and tools shall be strengthened by a constructivist approach based
on case studies and exercises.

Students who have successfully participated in this module will be able to

• . . . ,
• solve problems in Linear Algebra and Analysis and apply such mathematical methods to

quantitative problems in management.

• apply and challenge the knowledge critically on current issues and selected case studies.

Introduction

These lecture notes contain the entire material of the quantitative methods part of the ﬁrst semester
module 0.1.1 IMQM: Introduction to Management and its Quantitative Methods at Karl-
shochschule International University. The aim is to provide a selection of tried-and-tested math-
ematical tools that proved efﬁcient in actual practical problems of Economics and Management.
These tools constitute the foundation for a systematic treatment of the typical kinds of quantita-
tive problems one is confronted with in a Bachelor degree programme. Nevertheless, they provide
a sufﬁcient amount of points of contact with a quantitatively oriented subsequent Master degree
programme in Economics, Management, or the Social Sciences.

The prerequisites for a proper understanding of these lecture notes are modest, as they do not go
much beyond the basic A-levels standards in Mathematics. Besides the four fundamental arith-
metical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of real numbers, you should
be familiar, e.g., with manipulating fractions, dealing with powers of real numbers, the binomial
formulae, determining the point of intersection for two straight lines in the Euclidian plane, solv-
ing a quadratic algebraic equation, and the rules of differentiation of real-valued functions of one
variable.
It might be useful for the reader to have available a modern graphic display calculator (GDC) for
dealing with some of the calculations that necessarily arise along the way, when confronted with
speciﬁc quantitative problems. Some current models used in public schools and in undergraduate
studies are, amongst others,

• Texas Instruments TI–84 plus,
• Casio CFX–9850GB PLUS.

However, the reader is strongly encouraged to think about resorting, as an alternative, to a spread-
sheet programme such as EXCEL or OpenOfﬁce to handle the calculations one encounters in
one’s quantitative work.

The central theme of these lecture notes is the acquisition and application of a number of effec-
tive mathematical methods in a business oriented environment. In particular, we hereby focus on
quantitative processes of the sort

for which different kinds of functional relationships between some numerical INPUT quantities
and some numerical OUTPUT quantities are being considered. Of special interest in this context

INPUT → OUTPUT ,

3

4

will be ratios of the structure

OUTPUT
INPUT

.

CONTENTS

In this respect, it is a general objective in Economics to look for ways to optimise the value of
such ratios (in favour of some economic agent), either by seeking to increase the OUTPUT when
the INPUT is conﬁned to be ﬁxed, or by seeking to decrease the INPUT when the OUTPUT is
conﬁned to be ﬁxed. Consequently, most of the subsequent considerations in these lecture notes
will therefore deal with issues of optimisation of given functional relationships between some
variables, which manifest themselves either in minimisation or in maximisation procedures.

The structure of these lecture notes is the following. Part I presents selected mathematical methods
from Linear Algebra, which are discussed in Chs. 1 to 5. Applications of these methods focus on
the quantitative aspects of ﬂows of goods in simple economic models, as well as on problems in
linear programming. In Part II, which is limited to Ch. 6, we turn to discuss elementary aspects
of Financial Mathematics. Fundamental principles of Analysis, comprising differential and in-
tegral calculus for real-valued functions of one real variable, and their application to quantitative
economic problems, are reviewed in Part III; this extends across Chs. 7 and 8.

We emphasise the fact that there are no explicit examples nor exercises included in these lecture
notes. These are reserved exclusively for the lectures given throughout term time.

Recommended textbooks accompanying the lectures are the works by Asano (2013) [2], Dowl-
ing (2009) [11], Dowling (1990) [10], Bauer et al (2008) [3], Bosch (2003) [6], and H¨ulsmann
et al (2005) [16]. Some standard references of Applied Mathematics are, e.g., Bronstein et al
(2005) [7] and Arens et al (2008) [1]. Should the reader feel inspired by the aesthetics, beauty,
ellegance and efﬁciency of the mathematical methods presented, and, hence, would like to know
more about their background and relevance, as well as being introduced to further mathematical
techniques of interest, she/he is recommended to take a look at the brilliant books by Penrose
(2004) [21], Singh (1997) [23], Gleick(1987) [13] and Smith (2007) [24]. Note that most of the
textbooks and monographs mentioned in this Introduction are available from the library at Karl-
shochschule International University.

Finally, we draw the reader’s attention to the fact that the *.pdf version of these lecture notes con-
tains interactive features such as fully hyperlinked references to original publications at the web-
sites dx.doi.org and jstor.org, as well as active links to biographical information on sci-
entists that have been inﬂuential in the historical development of Mathematics, hosted by the web-
sites The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive (www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk)
and en.wikipedia.org.

Chapter 1

Vector algebra in Euclidian space Rn

Let us begin our elementary considerations of vector algebra with the introduction of a special
class of mathematical objects. These will be useful at a later stage, when we turn to formulate
certain problems of a quantitative nature in a compact and elegant way. Besides introducing these
mathematical objects, we also need to deﬁne which kinds of mathematical operations they can be
subjected to, and what computational rules we have to take care of.

1.1 Basic concepts

Given be a set V of mathematical objects a which, for now, we want to consider merely as a
collection of n arbitrary real numbers a1, . . . , ai, . . . , an. In explicit terms,

V =

a =

| ai ∈ R, i = 1, . . . , n

.

(1.1)

Formally the n real numbers considered can either be assembled in an ordered pattern as a column
or a row. We deﬁne
Def.: Real-valued column vector with n components

a :=

a1
...
ai
...
an







,

ai ∈ R,

i = 1, . . . , n ,

(1.2)

Notation: a ∈ Rn×1,
and

CHAPTER1. VECTORALGEBRAINEUCLIDIANSPACE RN

Def.: Real-valued row vector with n components

aT := (a1, . . . , ai, . . . , an) ,

ai ∈ R,

i = 1, . . . , n ,

(1.3)

Notation: aT ∈ R1×n.
Correspondingly, we deﬁne the n-component objects

0 :=

and

0T := (0, . . . , 0, . . . , 0)

(1.4)




0
...




to constitute related zero vectors.

Next we deﬁne for like objects in the set V , i.e., either for n-component column vectors or for
n-component row vectors, two simple computational operations. These are

Def.: Addition of vectors

a + b :=

a1
...
ai



=

a1 + b1

ai + bi

...

an + bn







,

ai, bi ∈ R ,

(1.5)

and

Def.: Rescaling of vectors

λa :=

λa1
...
λai
...
λan







,

λ, ai ∈ R .

(1.6)

The rescaling of a vector a with an arbitrary non-zero real number λ has the following effects:

• |λ| > 1 — stretching of the length of a
• 0 < |λ| < 1 — shrinking of the length of a
• λ < 0 — directional reversal of a.

1.2. DIMENSIONANDBASISOF RN

7

The notion of the length of a vector a will be made precise shortly.

The addition and the rescaling of n-component vectors satisfy the following addition and multipli-
cation laws:
Computational rules for addition and rescaling of vectors
For vectors a, b, c ∈ Rn:

1. a + b = b + a

2. a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c

(commutative addition)

(associative addition)

3. a + 0 = a
4. For every a, b ∈ Rn, there exists exactly one x ∈ Rn such that a + x = b

(addition identity element)

(invertibility of addition)

5. (λµ)a = λ(µa) with λ ∈ R
6. 1a = a

7. λ(a + b) = λa + λb;

(λ + µ)a = λa + µa with λ, µ ∈ R

(associative rescaling)

(rescaling identity element)

(distributive rescaling).

In conclusion of this section, we remark that every set of mathematical objects V constructed in
line with Eq. (1.1), with an addition and a rescaling deﬁned according to Eqs. (1.5) and (1.6), and
satisfying the laws stated above, constitutes a linear vector space over Euclidian space Rn.1

1.2 Dimension and basis of Rn

Let there be given m n-component vectors2 a1, . . . , ai, . . . , am ∈ Rn, as well as m real numbers
λ1, . . . , λi, . . . , λm ∈ R. The new n-component vector b resulting from the addition of arbitrarily
rescaled versions of these m vectors according to

b = λ1a1 + . . . + λiai + . . . + λmam =:

m

Xi=1

λiai ∈ Rn

(1.7)

is referred to as a linear combination of the m vectors ai, i = 1, . . . , m.
Def.: A set of m vectors a1, . . . , ai, . . . , am ∈ Rn is called linearly independent when the condi-
tion

0 != λ1a1 + . . . + λiai + . . . + λmam =

λiai ,

(1.8)

m

Xi=1

1This is named after the ancient greek mathematician Euclid of Alexandria (about 325 BC–265 BC).
2A slightly s horter notation for n-component column vectors a ∈ Rn×1 is given by a ∈ Rn; likewise aT ∈ Rn

for n-component row vectors aT ∈ R1×n.

8
CHAPTER1. VECTORALGEBRAINEUCLIDIANSPACE RN
i.e., the problem of forming the zero vector 0 ∈ Rn from a linear combination of the m vectors
a1, . . . , ai, . . . , am ∈ Rn, can only be solved trivially, namely by 0 = λ1 = . . . = λi = . . . = λm.
When, however, this condition can be solved non-trivially, with some λi 6= 0, then the set of m
vectors a1, . . . , ai, . . . , am ∈ Rn is called linearly dependent.
In Euclidian space Rn, there is a maximum number n (!) of vectors which can be linearly indepen-
dent. This maximum number is referred to as the dimension of Euclidian space Rn. Every set
of n linearly independent vectors in Euclidian space Rn constitutes a possible basis of Euclidian
space Rn. If the set {a1, . . . , ai, . . . , an} constitutes a basis of Rn, then every other vector b ∈ Rn
can be expressed in terms of these basis vectors by

b = β1a1 + . . . + βiai + . . . + βnan =

βiai .

(1.9)

Xi=1

The rescaling factors βi ∈ R of the ai ∈ Rn are called the components of vector b with respect
to the basis {a1, . . . , ai, . . . , an}.

1.3. EUCLIDIANSCALARPRODUCT
deﬁnes a mapping f : R1×n × Rn×1 → R from the product set of n-component row and column
vectors to the set of real numbers. Note that, in contrast to the addition and the rescaling of n-
component vectors, the outcome of forming a Euclidian scalar product between two n-component
vectors is a single real number.
In the context of the Euclidian scalar product, two non-zero vectors a, b ∈ Rn (wit a 6= 0 6= b)
are referred to as mutually orthogonal when they exhibit the property that 0 = aT · b = bT · a.
Computational rules for Euclidian scalar product of vectors
For vectors a, b, c ∈ Rn:

1. (a + b)T · c = aT · c + bT · c
2. aT · b = bT · a
3. (λaT ) · b = λ(aT · b) with λ ∈ R
4. aT · a > 0 for all a 6= 0

(distributive scalar product)

(commutative scalar product)

(homogeneous scalar product)

(positive deﬁnite scalar product).

Now we turn to introduce the notion of the length of an n-component vector.
Def.: The length of a vector a ∈ Rn is deﬁned via the Euclidian scalar product as

|a| := √aT · a =qa2

1 + . . . + a2

i + . . . + a2

n =:vuut

(1.13)

Technically one refers to the non-negative real number |a| as the absolute value or the Euclidian
norm of the vector a ∈ Rn. The length of a ∈ Rn has the following properties:

• |a| ≥ 0, and |a| = 0 ⇔ a = 0;
• |λa| = |λ||a| for λ ∈ R;
• |a + b| ≤ |a| + |b|

(triangle inequality).

Every non-zero vector a ∈ Rn, i.e., |a| > 0, can be rescaled by the reciprocal of its length. This
procedure deﬁnes the
Def.: Normalisation of a vector a ∈ Rn;

ˆa :=

a
|a|

⇒

|ˆa| = 1 .

(1.14)

By this method one generates a vector of length 1, i.e., a unit vector ˆa. To denote unit vectors we
will employ the “hat” symbol.

Lastly, also by means of the Euclidian scalar product, we introduce the angle enclosed between
two non-zero vectors.

sheet.

Matrices

In this chapter, we introduce a second class of mathematical objects that are more general than
vectors. For these objects, we will also deﬁne certain mathematical operations, and a set of com-
putational rules that apply in this context.

2.1 Matrices as linear mappings

Consider given a collection of m × n arbitrary real numbers a11, a12 . . . , aij, . . . , amn, which we
arrange systematically in a particular kind of array.

Def.: A real-valued (m × n)-matrix is formally deﬁned to constitute an array of real numbers
according to



A :=

where aij ∈ R, i = 1, . . . , m; j = 1, . . . , n.
Notation: A ∈ Rm×n.
Characteristic features of this array of real numbers are:

(2.1)

• m denotes the number of rows of A, n the number of columns of A.
• aij represents the elements of A; aij is located at the point of intersection of the ith row and

the jth column of A.

• elements of the ith row constitute the row vector (ai1, ai2, . . . , aij, . . . , ain), elements of the

Formally column vectors need to be viewed as (n × 1)-matrices, row vectors as (1 × n)-matrices.
An (m × n)-zero matrix, denoted by 0, has all its elements equal to zero, i.e.,

.

(2.2)

Matrices which have an equal number of rows and columns, i.e. m = n, are referred to as
quadratic matrices. In particular, the (n × n)-unit matrix (or identity matrix)

2.2. BASICCONCEPTS
a mapping A : Rn×1 → Rm×1, i.e. a mapping from the set of real-valued n-component column
vectors (here: x) to the set of real-valued m-component column vectors (here: y).
In loose analogy to the photographic process, x can be viewed as representing an “object,” A a
“camera,” and y the resultant “image.”
Since for real-valued vectors x1, x2 ∈ Rn×1 and real numbers λ ∈ R, mappings deﬁned by real-
valued matrices A ∈ Rm×n exhibit the two special properties

A(x1 + x2) = (Ax1) + (Ax2)

A(λx1) = λ(Ax1) ,

(2.5)

they constitute linear mappings.1
We now turn to discuss the most important mathematical operations deﬁned for (m× n)-matrices,
as well as the computational rules that obtain.

2.2 Basic concepts

Def.: Transpose of a matrix
For A ∈ Rm×n, we deﬁne the process of transposing A by
aT
ij := aji ,

AT :

(2.6)

where i = 1, . . . , m und j = 1, . . . , n. Note that it holds that AT ∈ Rn×m.
When transposing an (m×n)-matrix, one simply has to exchange the matrix’ rows with its columns
(and vice versa): the elements of the ﬁrst row become the elements of the ﬁrst column, etc. It
follows that, in particular,

(AT )T = A

(2.7)

applies.
Two special cases may occur for quadratic matrices (where m = n):

• When AT = A, one refers to A as a symmetric matrix.
• When AT = −A, one refers to A as an antisymmetric matrix.

Def.: Addition of matrices
For A, B ∈ Rm×n, the sum is given by

A + B =: C :

aij + bij =: cij ,

(2.8)

with i = 1, . . . , m and j = 1, . . . , n.
Note that an addition can be performed meaningfully only for matrices of the same format.

1It is important to note at this point that many advanced mathematical models designed to describe quantitative
aspects of some natural and economic phenomena do not satisfy the conditions (2.5), as they employ non-linear
mappings for this purpose. However, in such contexts, linear mappings often provide useful ﬁrst approximations.

14

Def.: Rescaling of matrices
For A ∈ Rm×n and λ ∈ R\{0}, let

CHAPTER2. MATRICES

λA =: C :

λaij =: cij ,

(2.9)

where i = 1, . . . , m and j = 1, . . . , n.

When rescaling a matrix, all its elements simply have to be multiplied by the same non-zero real
number λ.

Computational rules for addition and rescaling of matrices
For matrices A, B, C ∈ Rm×n:

1. A + B = B + A

2. A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C

3. A + 0 = A

(commutative addition)

(associative addition)

(addition identity element)

4. For every A and B, there exists exactly one Z such that A + Z = B.

5. (λµ)A = λ(µA) with λ, µ ∈ R\{0}
6. 1A = A

7. λ(A + B) = λA + λB;

(λ + µ)A = λA + µA with λ, µ ∈ R\{0}

8. (A + B)T = AT + BT

9. (λA)T = λAT with λ ∈ R\{0}.

(invertibility of addition)

(associative rescaling)

(rescaling identity element)

(distributive rescaling)

(transposition rule 1)

(transposition rule 2)

Next we introduce a particularly useful mathematical operation for matrices.

2.3 Matrix multiplication

Def.: For a real-valued (m × n)-matrix A and a real-valued (n × r)-matrix B, a matrix multipli-
cation is deﬁned by

AB =: C

(2.10)

ai1b1j + . . . + aikbkj + . . . + ainbnj =:Pn

k=1 aikbkj =: cij ,

with i = 1, . . . , m and j = 1, . . . , r, thus yielding as an outcome a real-valued (m × r)-matrix C.

2.3. MATRIXMULTIPLICATION

15

The element of C at the intersection of the ith row and the jth column is determined by the
computational rule

cij = Euclidian scalar product of ith row vector of A and jth column vector of B .

(2.11)

It is important to realise that the deﬁnition of a matrix multiplication just provided depends in
an essential way on the fact that matrix A on the left in the product needs to have as many (!)
columns as matrix B on the right rows. Otherwise, a matrix multiplication cannot be deﬁned in a
meaningful way.
GDC: For matrices [A] and [B] edited beforehand, of matching formats, their matrix multiplication
can be evaluated in mode MATRIX → NAMES by [A] ∗ [B].
Computational rules for matrix multiplication
For A, B, C real-valued matrices of correspondingly matching formats we have:

1. AB = 0 is possible with A 6= 0, B 6= 0.
2. A(BC) = (AB)C

3. A 1

A = A

∈Rn×n

4. (A + B)C = AC + BC

(zero divisor)

(associative matrix multiplication)

(multiplicative identity element)

C(A + B) = CA + CB

5. A(λB) = (λA)B = λ(AB) with λ ∈ R
6. (AB)T = BT AT

(distributive matrix multiplication)

(homogeneous matrix multiplication)

(transposition rule).

CHAPTER2. MATRICES

Chapter 3

Systems of linear algebraic equations

In this chapter, we turn to address a particular ﬁeld of application of the notions of matrices and
vectors, or of linear mappings in general.

3.1 Basic concepts

Let us begin with a system of m ∈ N linear algebraic equations, wherein every single equation can
be understood to constitute a constraint on the range of values of n ∈ N variables x1, . . . , xn ∈ R.
The objective is to determine all possible values of x1, . . . , xn ∈ R which satisfy these constraints
simultaneously. Problems of this kind, namely systems of linear algebraic equations, are often
represented in the form
• Representation 1:

a11x1 + . . . + a1jxj + . . . + a1nxn = b1

...

ai1x1 + . . . + aijxj + . . . + ainxn = bi

...

am1x1 + . . . + amjxj + . . . + amnxn = bm .

(3.1)

Depending on how the natural numbers m and n relate to one another, systems of linear algebraic
equations can be classiﬁed as follows:

• m < n: fewer equations than variables; the linear system is under-determined,
• m = n: same number of equations as variables; the linear system is well-determined,
• m > n: more equations than variables; the linear system is over-determined.

A more compact representation of a linear system of format (m × n) is given by

17

(3.2)

The mathematical objects employed in this variant of a linear system are as follows: A takes the
central role of the coefﬁcient matrix of the linear system, of format (m × n), x is its variable
vector, of format (n × 1), and, lastly, b is its image vector, of format (m × 1).
When dealing with systems of linear algebraic equations in the form of Representation 2, i.e.
Ax = b, the main question to be answered is:

Question: For given coefﬁcient matrix A and image vector b, can we ﬁnd a variable vector x
that A maps onto b?

In a sense this describes the inversion of the photographic process we had previously referred to:
we have given the camera and we already know the image, but we have yet to ﬁnd a matching
object. Remarkably, to address this issue, we can fall back on a simple algorithmic method due to
the German mathematician and astronomer Carl Friedrich Gauß (1777–1855).

3.2 Gaußian elimination

The algorithmic solution technique developed by Gauß is based on the insight that the solution set
of a linear system of m algebraic equations for n real-valued variables, i.e.

remains unchanged under the following algebraic equivalence transformations of the linear sys-
tem:

Ax = b ,

(3.3)

1. changing the order amongst the equations,

2. multiplication of any equation by a non-zero real number c 6= 0,
3. addition of a multiple of one equation to another equation,

4. changing the order amongst the equations.

Speciﬁcally, this implies that we may manipulate a given linear system by means of these four
different kinds of equivalence transformations without ever changing its identity. In concrete cases,
however, one should not apply these equivalence transformations at random but rather follow a
target oriented strategy. This is what Gaußian elimination can provide.

by means of the four kinds of equivalence transformations such that the resultant simpler ﬁnal
linear system may easily be solved using backward substitution.
Three exclusive cases of possible solution content for a given system of linear algebraic equations
do exist. The linear system may possess either

1. no solution at all, or

2. a unique solution, or

3. multiple solutions.

Remark: Linear systems that are under-determined, i.e., when m < n, can never be solved
uniquely due to the fact that in such a case there not exist enough equations to constrain the values
of all of the n variables.
GDC: For a stored augmented coefﬁcient matrix [A] of format (m× n + 1), associated with a given
(m × n) linear system, select mode MATRIX → MATH and then call the function rref([A]). It is
possible that backward substitution needs to be employed to obtain the ﬁnal solution.
For completeness, we want to turn brieﬂy to the issue of solvability of a system of linear algebraic
equations. To this end, we need to introduce the notion of the rank of a matrix.

3.3 Rank of a matrix

Def.: A real-valued matrix A ∈ Rm×n possesses the rank

rank(A) = r ,

r ≤ min{m, n}

(3.6)

if and only if r is the maximum number of row resp. column vectors of A which are linearly
independent. Clearly, r can only be as large as the smaller of the numbers m and n that determine
the format of A.

20
CHAPTER3. SYSTEMSOFLINEARALGEBRAICEQUATIONS
For quadratic matrices A ∈ Rn×n, there is available a more elegant measure to determine its
rank. This (in the present case real-valued) measure is referred to as the determinant of matrix A,
det(A), and is deﬁned as follows.

Def.:

(i) When A ∈ R2×2, its determinant is given by
a11 a12

det(A) :=(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

a21 a22 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

i.e. the difference between the products of A’s on-diagonal elements and A’s off-diagonal
elements.

:= a11a22 − a12a21 ,

(3.7)

(ii) When A ∈ R3×3, the deﬁnition of A’s determinant is more complex. In that case it is

given by

det(A)

a11 a12 a13
a21 a22 a23
a31 a32 a33

:= (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

:= a11(a22a33 − a32a23) + a21(a32a13 − a12a33) + a31(a12a23 − a22a13) .(3.8)
Observe, term by term, the cyclic permutation of the ﬁrst index of the elements aij according
to the rule 1 → 2 → 3 → 1.

(iii) Finally, for the (slightly involved) deﬁnition of the determinant of a higher-dimensional

matrix A ∈ Rn×n, please refer to the literature; e.g. Bronstein et al (2005) [7, p 267].

To determine the rank of a given quadtratic matrix A ∈ Rn×n, one now installs the following
criteria: rank(A) = r = n, if det(A) 6= 0, and rank(A) = r < n, if det(A) = 0. In the ﬁrst case,
A is referred to as regular, in the second as singular. For quadratic matrices A that are singular,
rank(A) = r (with r < n) is given by the number r of rows (or columns) of the largest possible
non-zero subdeterminant of A.
GDC: For a stored quadratic matrix [A], select mode MATRIX → MATH and obtain its determinant
by calling the function det([A]).

3.4 Criteria for solving systems of linear algebraic equations

Making use of the concept of the rank of a real-valued matrix A ∈ Rm×n, we can now summarise
the solution content of a speciﬁc system of linear algebraic equations of format (m× n) in a table.
For given linear system

Ax = b ,

with coefﬁcient matrix A ∈ Rm×n, variable vector x ∈ Rn×1 and image vector b ∈ Rm×1, there

(A|b) here denotes the augmented coefﬁcient matrix.
Next we discuss a particularly useful property of regular quadratic matrices.

3.5 Inverse of a regular (n × n)-matrix
Def.: Let a real-valued quadratic matrix A ∈ Rn×n be regular, i.e., det(A) ∈ R\{0}. Then there
exists an inverse matrix A−1 to A deﬁned by the characterising properties

A−1A = AA−1 = 1 .

(3.9)

Here 1 denotes the (n × n)-unit matrix [cf. Eq. (2.3)].

When a computational device is not at hand, the inverse matrix A−1 of a regular quadratic matrix
A can be obtained by solving the matrix-valued linear system

AX != 1

(3.10)

for the unknown matrix X by means of simultaneous Gaußian elimination.

GDC: For a stored quadratic matrix [A], its inverse matrix can be simply obtained as [A]−1, where
the x−1 function key needs to be used.

22

CHAPTER3. SYSTEMSOFLINEARALGEBRAICEQUATIONS

Computational rules for the inverse operation
For A, B ∈ Rn×n, with det(A) 6= 0 6= det(B), it holds that

1. (A−1)−1 = A

2. (AB)−1 = B−1A−1

3. (AT )−1 = (A−1)T

4. (λA)−1 =

1
λ

A−1.

The special interest in applications in the concept of inverse matrices arises for the following
reason. Consider given a well-determined linear system

Ax = b ,

with regular quadratic coefﬁcient matrix A ∈ Rn×n, i.e., det(A) 6= 0. Then, for A, there exists an
inverse matrix A−1. Matrix-multiplying both sides of the equation above from the left (!) by the
inverse A−1, results in

A−1(Ax) = (A−1A)x = 1x = x

= A−1b

.

(3.11)

|

}

right-hand side

|{z}

In this case, the unique solution (!) x = A−1b of the linear system arises simply from matrix
multiplication of the image vector b by the inverse matrix of A. (Of course, it might actually
require a bit of computational work to determine A−1.)

3.6 Outlook

There are a number of exciting advanced topics in Linear Algebra. Amongst them one ﬁnds
the concept of the characteristic eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors of quadratic matrices,
which has particularly high relevance in practical applications. The question to be answered here
is the following: for given real-valued quadratic matrix A ∈ Rn×n, do there exist real numbers
λn ∈ R and real-valued vectors vn ∈ Rn×1 which satisfy the condition

Avn

!= λnvn ?

(3.12)

Put differently: for which vectors vn ∈ Rn×1 does their mapping by a quadratic matrix A ∈ Rn×n
amount to simple rescalings by real numbers λn ∈ R?
By re-arranging, Eq. (3.12) can be recast into the form

0 != (A − λn1) vn ,

(3.13)

23
3.6. OUTLOOK
with 1 an (n × n)-unit matrix [cf. Eq. (2.3)] and 0 an n-component zero vector. This condition
corresponds to a homogeneous system of linear algebraic equations of format (n× n). Non-trivial
solutions vn 6= 0 to this system exist provided that the so-called characteristic equation

0 != det (A − λn1) ,

(3.14)

a polynomial of degree n (cf. Sec. 7.1.1), allows for real-valued roots λn ∈ R. Note that symmetric
quadratic matrices (cf. Sec. 2.2) possess exclusively real-valued eigenvalues λn. When these
eigenvalues turn out to be all different, then the associated eigenvectors vn prove to be mutually
orthogonal.
Knowledge of the spectrum of eigenvalues λn ∈ R and associated eigenvectors vn ∈ Rn×1
of a real-valued matrix A ∈ Rn×n provides the basis of a transformation of A to its diagonal
form Aλn, thus yielding a diagonal matrix which features the eigenvalues λn as its on-diagonal
elements; cf. Leon (2009) [19].

Amongst other examples, the concept of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of quadratic real-valued
matrices plays a special role in Statistics, in the context of exploratory principal component
analyses of multivariate data sets, where the objective is to identify dominant intrinsic structures;
cf. Hair et al (2010) [14, Ch. 3] and Ref. [12, App. A].

We now turn to discuss some speciﬁc applications of Linear Algebra in economic theory. To
begin with, let us consider quantitative aspects of the exchange of goods between a certain number
of economic agents. We here aim at a simpliﬁed abstract description of real economic processes.

The quantitative model
economist Wassily Wassilyovich Leontief (1905–1999),
for which,
Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.
Suppose given an economic system consisting of n ∈ N interdependent economic agents ex-
changing between them the goods they produce. For simplicity we want to assume that every one
of these economic agents represents the production of a single good only. Presently we intend
to monitor the ﬂow of goods in this simple economic system during a speciﬁed reference period
of time. The total numbers of the n goods leaving the production sector of this model constitute
the OUTPUT quantities. The INPUT quantities to the production sector are twofold. On the
one hand, there are exogenous INPUT quantities which we take to be given by m ∈ N different
kinds of external resources needed in differing proportions to produce the n goods. On the other
hand, due to their mutual interdependence, some of the economic agents require goods made by
their neighbours to be able to produce their own goods; these constitute the endogenous INPUT
quantities of the system. Likewise, the production sector’s total OUTPUT during the chosen ref-
erence period of the n goods can be viewed to ﬂow through one of two separate channels: (i) the
exogenous channel linking the production sector to external consumers representing an open
market, and (ii) the endogenous channel linking the economic agents to their neighbours (thus
respresenting their interdependencies). It is supposed that momentum is injected into the economic
system, triggering the ﬂow of goods between the different actors, by the prospect of increasing

25

26

CHAPTER4. LEONTIEF’SINPUT–OUTPUTMATRIXMODEL

the value of the INPUT quantities, in line with the notion of the economic value chain.

Leontief’s model is based on the following three elementary
Assumptions:

1. For all goods involved the functional relationship between INPUT and OUTPUT quantities

be of a linear nature [cf. Eq. (2.5)].

2. The proportions of “INPUT quantities to OUTPUT quantities” be constant over the refer-

ence period of time considered; the ﬂows of goods are thus considered to be stationary.

3. Economic equilibrium obtains during the reference period of time: the numbers of goods

then supplied equal the numbers of goods then demanded.

The mathematical formulation of Leontief’s quantitative model employs the following
Vector- and matrix-valued quantities:

1. q — total output vector ∈ Rn×1, components qi ≥ 0 units
2. y — ﬁnal demand vector ∈ Rn×1, components yi ≥ 0 units
3. P — input–output matrix ∈ Rn×n, components Pij ≥ 0
4. (1 − P) — technology matrix ∈ Rn×n, regular, hence, invertible
5. (1 − P)−1 — total demand matrix ∈ Rn×n
6. v — resource vector ∈ Rm×1, components vi ≥ 0 units
7. R — resource consumption matrix ∈ Rm×n, components Rij ≥ 0,

where 1 denotes the (n × n)-unit matrix [cf. Eq. (2.3)]. Note that the components of all the
vectors involved, as well as of the input–output matrix and of the resource consumption matrix,
can assume non-negative values (!) only.

4.2 Input–output matrix and resource consumption matrix

We now turn to provide the deﬁnition of the two central matrix-valued quantities in Leontief’s
model. We will also highlight their main characteristic features.

4.2.1 Input–output matrix
Suppose the reference period of time has ended for the economic system in question, i.e.
the
stationary ﬂows of goods have stopped eventually. We now want to take stock of the numbers of
goods that have been delivered by each of the n economic agents in the system. Say that during
the reference period considered, agent 1 delivered of their good the number n11 to themselves, the
number n12 to agent 2, the number n13 to agent 3, and so on, and, lastly, the number n1n to agent n.

4.2. INPUT–OUTPUTMATRIXANDRESOURCECONSUMPTIONMATRIX

27

The number delivered by agent 1 to external consumers shall be denoted by y1. Since in this model
a good produced cannot all of a sudden disappear again, and since by Assumption 3 above the
number of goods supplied must be equal to the number of goods demanded, we ﬁnd that for the
total output of agent 1 it holds that q1 := n11 + . . . + n1j + . . . + n1n + y1. Analogous relations
hold for the total output q2, q3, . . . , qn of each of the remaining n − 1 agents. We thus obtain the
intermediate result

q1 = n11 + . . . + n1j + . . . + n1n + y1 > 0

...

qi = ni1 + . . . + nij + . . . + nin + yi > 0

...

qn = nn1 + . . . + nnj + . . . + nnn + yn > 0 .

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

This simple system of balance equations can be summarised in terms of a standard input–output
table as follows:

The ﬁrst column of this table lists all the n different sources of ﬂows of goods (or suppliers of
goods), while its ﬁrst row shows the n + 1 different sinks of ﬂows of goods (or consumers of
goods). The last column contains the total output of each of the n agents in the reference period
of time.

Next we compute for each of the n agents the respective values of the non-negative ratios

Pij :=

(4.5)

and not by the total output qi of the supplying agent i. In the latter case the Pij would represent percentages of the
total output qi.

28

with i, j = 1, . . . , n. These n× n = n2 different ratios may be naturally viewed as the elements of
a quadratic matrix P of format (n × n). In general, this matrix is given by

P =

(4.6)
and is referred to as Leontief’s input–output matrix of the stationary economic system under
investigation.
For the very simple case with just n = 3 producing agents, the input–output matrix reduces to

P =

 .

It is important to realise that for an actual economic system the input–output matrix P can be
determined only once the reference period of time chosen has come to an end.
The utility of Leontief’s stationary input–output matrix model is in its application for the purpose
of forecasting. This is done on the basis of an extrapolation, namely by assuming that an input–
output matrix Preference period obtained from data taken during a speciﬁc reference period also is valid
(to an acceptable degree of accuracy) during a subsequent period, i.e.,

Psubsequent period ≈ Preference period ,

or, in component form,

Pij|subsequent period =

nij

qj (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)subsequent period ≈ Pij|reference period =

nij

qj (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)reference period

In this way it becomes possible to compute for a given (idealised) economic system approximate
numbers of INPUT quantities required during a near future production period from the known
numbers of OUTPUT quantities of the most recent production period. Long-term empirical ex-
perience has shown that this method generally leads to useful results to a reasonable approximation.
All of these calculations are grounded on linear relationships describing the quantitative aspects of
stationary ﬂows of goods, as we will soon elucidate.

(4.7)

.

(4.8)

4.2.2 Resource consumption matrix
The second matrix-valued quantity central to Leontief’s stationary model is the resource con-
sumption matrix R. This may be interpreted as providing a recipe for the amounts of the m dif-
ferent kinds of external resources (the exogenous INPUT quantities) that are needed in the pro-
duction of the n goods (the OUTPUT quantities). Its elements are deﬁned as the ratios

Rij := amounts (in units) required of resource i for the production of one unit of good j ,

(4.9)

4.3. STATIONARYLINEARFLOWSOFGOODS

29

with i = 1, . . . , m und j = 1, . . . , n. The rows of matrix R thus contain information concerning the
m resources, the columns information concerning the n goods. Note that in general the (m × n)
resource consumption matrix R is not (!) a quadratic matrix and, therefore, in general not
invertible.

4.3 Stationary linear ﬂows of goods

4.3.1 Flows of goods: endogenous INPUT to total OUTPUT
We now turn to a quantitative description of the stationary ﬂows of goods that are associated
with the total output q during a speciﬁc period of time considered. According to Leontief’s
Assumption 1, there exists a linear functional relationship between the endogenous vector-valued
INPUT quantity q − y and the vector-valued OUTPUT quantity q. This may be represented in
terms of a matrix-valued relationship as

q − y = Pq ⇔ qi − yi =

Pijqj ,

n

Xj=1

(4.10)

with i = 1, . . . , n, in which the input–output matrix P takes the role of mediating a mapping
between either of these vector-valued quantities. According to Assumption 2, the elements of the
input–output matrix P remain constant for the period of time considered, i.e. the corresponding
ﬂows of goods are assumed to be stationary.
Relation (4.10) may also be motivated from an alternative perspective that takes the physical sci-
ences as a guidline. Namely, the total numbers q of the n goods produced during the period of
time considered which, by Assumption 3, are equal to the numbers supplied of the n goods satisfy
a conservation law: “whatever has been produced of the n goods during the period of time con-
sidered cannot get lost in this period.” In quantitative terms this simple relationship may be cast
into the form

=

+

.

total output

ﬁnal demand (exogenous)

deliveries to production sector (endogenous)

q

|{z}

y

|{z}

Pq

|{z}

For computational purposes this central stationary ﬂow of goods relation (4.10) may be rearranged
as is convenient. In this context it is helpful to make use of the matrix identity q = 1q, where 1
denotes the (n × n)-unit matrix [cf. Eq. (2.3)].
Examples:

(i) given/known: P, q

Then it applies that

y = (1 − P)q ⇔ yi =

with i = 1, . . . , n; (1 − P) represents the invertible technology matrix of the economic
system regarded.

n

Xj=1

(δij − Pij)qj ,

(4.11)

30

CHAPTER4. LEONTIEF’SINPUT–OUTPUTMATRIXMODEL

(ii) given/known: P, y

Then it holds that

q = (1 − P)−1y ⇔ qi =

n

Xj=1

(δij − Pij)−1yj ,

(4.12)

with i = 1, . . . , n; (1 − P)−1 here denotes the total demand matrix, i.e., the inverse of the
technology matrix.

4.3.2 Flows of goods: exogenous INPUT to total OUTPUT

Likewise, by Assumption 1, a linear functional relationship is supposed to exist between the ex-
ogenous vector-valued INPUT quantity v and the vector-valued OUTPUT quantity q. In matrix
language this can be expressed by

v = Rq ⇔ vi =

Rijqj ,

n

Xj=1

(4.13)

with i = 1, . . . , m. By Assumption 2, the elements of the resource consumption matrix R remain
constant during the period of time considered, i.e., the corresponding resource ﬂows are supposed
to be stationary.

By combination of Eqs. (4.13) and (4.12), it is possible to compute the numbers v of resources
required (during the period of time considered) for the production of the n goods for given ﬁnal
demand y. It applies that

v = Rq = R(1 − P)−1y ⇔ vi =

n

Xj=1

n

Xk=1

Rij(δjk − Pjk)−1yk ,

(4.14)

with i = 1, . . . , m.
GDC: For problems with n ≤ 5, and known matrices P and R, Eqs. (4.11), (4.12) and (4.14) can
be immediately used to calculate the quantities q from given quantities y, or vice versa.

4.4 Outlook

Leontief’s input–output matrix model may be extended in a straightforward fashion to include
more advanced considerations of economic theory. Supposing a closed though not necessarily
stationary economic system G comprising n interdependent economic agents producing n differ-
ent goods, one may assign monetary values to the INPUT quantity v as well as to the OUTPUT
quantities q and y of the system. Besides the numbers of goods produced and the associated
ﬂows of goods one may monitor with respect to G for a given period of time, one can in addition
analyse in time and space the amount of money coupled to the different goods, and the corre-
sponding ﬂows of money. However, contrary to the number of goods, in general there does not

4.4. OUTLOOK

31

exist a conservation law for the amount of money with respect to G. This may render the analysis
of ﬂows of money more difﬁcult, because, in the sense of an increase in value, money can either
be generated inside G during the period of time considered or it can likewise be annihilated; it is
not just limited to either ﬂowing into respectively ﬂowing out of G. Central to considerations of
this kind is a balance equation for the amount of money contained in G during a given period of
time, which is an additive quantity. Such balance equations constitute familiar tools in Physics (cf.
Herrmann (2003) [15, p 7ff]). Its structure in the present case is given by2


 =(cid:18) ﬂux of money

into G [in CU/TU] (cid:19)+(cid:18) rate of generation of money

in G [in CU/TU]

(cid:19) .

Note that, with respect to G, both ﬂuxes of money and rates of generation of money can in prin-
ciple possess either sign, positive or negative. To deal with these quantitative issues properly,
one requires the technical tools of the differential and integral calculus which we will discuss
at an elementary level in Chs. 7 and 8. We make contact here with the interdisciplinary science
of Econophysics (cf., e.g., Bouchaud and Potters (2003) [5]), a very interesting and challenging
subject which, however, is beyond the scope of these lecture notes.

Leontief’s input–output matrix model, and its possible extension as outlined here, provide the
quantitative basis for considerations of economical ratios of the kind

as mentioned in the Introduction. In addition, dimensionless (scale-invariant) ratios of the form

referred to as economic efﬁciency, can be computed for and compared between different economic
systems and their underlying production sectors. In Ch. 7 we will brieﬂy reconsider this issue.

Linear programming

On the backdrop of the economic principle, we discuss in this chapter a special class of quanti-
tative problems that frequently arise in speciﬁc practical applications in Business and Manage-
ment. Generally one distinguishes between two variants of the economic principle: either (i) to
draw maximum utility from limited resources, or (ii) to reach a speciﬁc target with minimum ef-
fort (costs). With regard to the ratio (OUTPUT)/(INPUT) put into focus in the Introduction, the
issue is to ﬁnd an optimal value for this ratio under given boundary conditions. This aim can be
realised either (i) by increasing the (positive) value of the numerator for ﬁxed (positive) value of
the denominator, or (ii) by decreasing the (positive) value of the denominator for ﬁxed (positive)
value of the numerator. The class of quantitative problems to be looked at in some detail in this
chapter typically relate to boundary conditions according to case (i).

5.1 Exposition of a quantitative problem

To be maximised is a (non-negative) real-valued quantity z, which depends in a linear functional
fashion on a ﬁxed number of n (non-negative) real-valued variables x1, . . . , xn. We suppose that
the n variables x1, . . . , xn in turn are constrained by a ﬁxed number m of algebraic conditions,
which also are assumed to depend on x1, . . . , xn in a linear fashion. These m constraints, or
restrictions, shall have the character of imposing upper limits on m different kinds of resources.

Def.: Consider a matrix A ∈ Rm×n, a vector b ∈ Rm×1, two vectors c, x ∈ Rn×1, and a constant
d ∈ R. A quantitative problem of the form

max(cid:8)z = cT · x + d |Ax ≤ b, x ≥ 0(cid:9) ,

33

(5.1)

or, expressed in terms of a component notation,

xn ≥ 0 ,

(5.2)
(5.3)

(5.4)
(5.5)

(5.6)

is referred to as a standard maximum problem of linear programming with n real-valued vari-
ables. The different quantities and relations appearing in this deﬁnition are called

• z(x1, . . . , xn) — linear objective function, the dependent variable,
• x1, . . . , xn — n independent variables,
• Ax ≤ b — m restrictions,
• x ≥ 0 — n non-negativity constraints.

Remark: In an analogous fashion one may also formulate a standard minimum problem of
linear programming, which can be cast into the form

min(cid:8)z = cT · x + d |Ax ≥ b, x ≥ 0(cid:9) .

In this case, the components of the vector b need to be interpreted as lower limits on certain
capacities.

For given linear objective function z(x1, . . . , xn), the set of points x = (x1, . . . , xn)T satisfying
the condition

z(x1, . . . , xn) = C = constant ∈ R ,

(5.7)

for ﬁxed value of C, is referred to as an isoquant of z. Isoquants of linear objective functions
of n = 2 independent variables constitute straight lines, of n = 3 independent variables Euclid-
ian planes, of n = 4 independent variables Euclidian 3-spaces (or hyperplanes), and of n ≥ 5
independent variables Euclidian (n − 1)-spaces (or hyperplanes).
In the simplest cases of linear programming, the linear objective function z depends on n = 2
variables x1 and x2 only. An illustrative and efﬁcient method of solving problems of this kind will
be looked at in the following section.

35
5.2. GRAPHICALSOLUTIONMETHOD
5.2 Graphical method for solving problems with two indepen-

dent variables

The systematic graphical solution method of standard maximum problems of linear programming
with n = 2 independent variables comprises the following steps:

1. Derivation of the linear objective function

in dependence on the variables x1 and x2.

z(x1, x2) = c1x1 + c2x2 + d

2. Identiﬁcation in the x1, x2–plane of the feasible region D of z which is determined by the
m restrictions imposed on x1 and x2. Speciﬁcally, D constitutes the domain of z (cf. Ch. 7).

3. Plotting in the x1, x2–plane of the projection of the isoquant of the linear objective function z
which intersects the origin (0 = x1 = x2). When c2 6= 0, this projection is described by the
equation

4. Erecting in the origin of the x1, x2–plane the direction of optimisation for z which is deter-

mined by the constant z-gradient

x2 = −(c1/c2)x1 .

(∇z)T =(cid:18) ∂z

∂x2 (cid:19) =(cid:18) c1

∂x1
∂z

c2 (cid:19) .

5. Parallel displacement in the x1, x2–plane of the projection of the (0, 0)-isoquant of z along
the direction of optimisation (∇z)T across the feasible region D out to a distance where the
projected isoquant just about touches D.

6. Determination of the optimal solution (x1O, x2O) as the point resp. set of points of inter-
section between the displaced projection of the (0, 0)-isoquant of z and the far boundary
of D.

7. Computation of the optimal value of the linear objective function zO = z(x1O, x2O) from

the optimal solution (x1O, x2O).

8. Speciﬁcation of potential remaining resources by substitution of the optimal solution

(x1O, x2O) into the m restrictions.

In general one ﬁnds that for a linear objective function z with n = 2 independent variables x1
and x2, the feasible region D, when non-empty and bounded, constitutes an area in the x1, x2–
plane with straight edges and a certain number of vertices. In these cases, the optimal values of
the linear objective function z are always to be found either at the vertices or on the edges of the
feasible region D. When D is an empty set, then there exists no solution to the corresponding
linear programming problem. When D is unbounded, again there may not exist a solution to the
linear programming problem, but this then depends on the speciﬁc circumstances that apply.

36

CHAPTER5. LINEARPROGRAMMING

Remark: To solve a standard minimum problem of linear programming with n = 2 indepen-
dent variables by means of the graphical method, one needs to parallelly displace in the x1, x2–
plane the projection of the (0, 0)-isoquant of z along the direction of optimisation (∇z)T until
contact is made with the feasible region D for the ﬁrst time. The optimal solution is then given by
the point resp. set of points of intersection between the displaced projection of the (0, 0)-isoquant
of z and the near boundary of D.

5.3 Dantzig’s simplex algorithm

The main disadvantage of the graphical solution method is its limitation to problems with
only n = 2 independent variables.
In actual practice, however, one is often concerned with
linear programming problems that depend on more than two independent variables. To
deal with these more complex problems in a systematic fashion, the US-American mathemati-
cian George Bernard Dantzig (1914–2005) has devised during the 1940ies an efﬁcient algorithm
which can be programmed on a computer in a fairly straightforward fashion; cf. Dantzig
(1949,1955) [8, 9].

In mathematics, simplex is an alternative name used to refer to a convex polyhedron, i.e., a body of
ﬁnite (hyper-)volume in two or more dimensions bounded by linear (hyper-)surfaces which inter-
sect in linear edges and vertices. In general the feasible regions of linear programming problems
constitute such simplexes. Since the optimal solutions for the independent variables of linear
programming problems, when they exist, are always to be found at a vertex or along an edge of
simplex feasible regions, Dantzig developed his so-called simplex algorithm such that it system-
atically scans the edges and vertices of a feasible region to identify the optimal solution (when it
exists) in as few steps as possible.

The starting point be a standard maximum problem of linear programming with n indepen-
dent variables in the form of relations (5.2)–(5.6). First, by introducing m non-negative slack
variables s1, . . . , sm, one transforms the m linear restrictions (inequalities) into an equivalent set
of m linear equations. In this way, potential differences between the left-hand and the right-hand
sides of the m inequalities are represented by the slack variables. In combination with the deﬁning
equation of the linear objective function z, one thus is confronted with a system of 1 + m linear
algebraic equations for the 1 + n + m variables z, x1, . . . , xn, s1, . . . , sm, given by
Maximum problem of linear programming in canonical form

z − c1x1 − c2x2 − . . . − cnxn = d
a11x1 + a12x2 + . . . + a1nxn + s1 = b1
a21x1 + a22x2 + . . . + a2nxn + s2 = b2

...

am1x1 + am2x2 + . . . + amnxn + sm = bm .

(5.8)
(5.9)
(5.10)

(5.11)

As discussed previously in Ch. 3, a system of linear algebraic equations of format (1 + m) ×
(1 + n + m) is under-determined and so, at most, allows for multiple solutions. The general

5.3. DANTZIG’SSIMPLEXALGORITHM

(1 + n + m)-dimensional solution vector

xL = (zL, x1,L, . . . , xn,L, s1,L, . . . , sm,L)T

37

(5.12)

thus contains n variables the values of which can be chosen arbitrarily. It is very important to be
aware of this fact. It implies that, given the linear system is solvable in the ﬁrst place, one has a
choice amongst different solutions, and so one can pick the solution which proves optimal for the
given problem at hand. Dantzig’s simplex algorithm constitues a tool for determining such an
optimal solution in a systematic way.
Let us begin by transferring the coefﬁcients and right-hand sides (RHS) of the under-determined
linear system introduced above into a particular kind of simplex tableau.

In such a simplex tableau one distinguishes so-called basis variables from non-basis variables.
Basis variables are those that contain in their respective columns in the number tableau a (1 + m)-
component canonical unit vector [cf. Eq. (1.10)]; in total the simplex tableau contains 1 + m of
these. Non-basis variables are the remaining ones that do not contain a canonical basis vector
in their respective columns; there exist n of this kind. The complete basis can thus be perceived
as spanning a (1 + m)-dimensional Euclidian space R1+m. Initially, always z and the m slack
variables s1, . . . , sm constitute the basis variables, while the n independent variables x1, . . . , xn
classify as non-basis variables [cf. the initial tableau (5.13)]. The corresponding so-called (ﬁrst)
basis solution has the general appearance

xB1 = (zB1, x1,B1, . . . , xn,B1, s1,B1, . . . , sm,B1)T = (d, 0, . . . , 0, b1, . . . , bm)T ,

since, for simplicity, each of the n arbitrarily speciﬁable non-basis variables may be assigned the
special value zero. In this respect basis solutions will always be special solutions (as opposed
to general ones) of the under-determined system (5.8)–(5.11) — the maximum problem of linear
programming in canonical form.
Central aim of the simplex algorithm is to bring as many of the n independent vari-
ables x1, . . . , xn as possible into the (1 + m)-dimensional basis, at the expense of one of the
m slack variables s1, . . . , sm, one at a time, in order to construct successively more favourable
special vector-valued solutions to the optimisation problem at hand. Ultimately, the simplex algo-
rithm needs to be viewed as a special variant of Gaußian elimination as discussed in Ch. 3, with a
set of systematic instructions concerning allowable equivalence transformations of the underlying
under-determined linear system (5.8)–(5.11), resp. the initial simplex tableau (5.13). This set of
systematic algebraic simplex operations can be summarised as follows:

When the ﬁnal simplex tableau has been arrived at, one again assigns the non-basis variables the
value zero. The values of the ﬁnal basis variables corresponding to the optimal solution of the
given linear programming problem are then to be determined from the ﬁnal simplex tableau by
backward substitution, beginning at the bottom row. Note that slack variables with positive values
belonging to the basis variables in the optimal solution provide immediate information on existing
remaining capacities in the problem at hand.

Elementary ﬁnancial mathematics

In this chapter we want to provide a brief introduction into some basic concepts of ﬁnancial math-
ematics. As we will try to emphasise, many applications of these concepts (that have immediate
practical relevance) are founded on only two simple and easily accessible mathematical structures:
the so-called arithmetical and geometrical real-valued sequences and their associated ﬁnite series.

6.1 Arithmetical and geometrical sequences and series

6.1.1 Arithmetical sequence and series
An arithmetical sequence of n ∈ N real numbers an ∈ R,

(an)n∈N ,

is deﬁned by the property that the difference d between neighbouring elements in the sequence be
constant, i.e., for n > 1

(6.1)
with an, an−1, d ∈ R. Given this recursive formation rule, one may infer the explicit representa-
tion of an arithmetical sequence as

an − an−1 =: d = constant 6= 0 ,

an = a1 + (n − 1)d with n ∈ N .

(6.2)

Note that any arithmetical sequence is uniquely determined by the two free parameters a1 and d,
the starting value of the sequence and the constant difference between neighbours in the sequence,
respectively. Equation (6.2) shows that the elements an in a non-trivial arithmetical sequence
exhibit either linear growth or linear decay with n.
When one calculates for an arithmetical sequence of n + 1 real numbers the arithmetical mean
of the immediate neighbours of any particular element an (with n ≥ 2), one ﬁnds that
(a1 + (n − 2)d + a1 + nd) = a1 + (n − 1)d = an .

6.1.2 Geometrical sequence and series
A geometrical sequence of n ∈ N real numbers an ∈ R,

is deﬁned by the property that the quotient q between neighbouring elements in the sequence be
constant, i.e., for n > 1

an
an−1

=: q = constant 6= 0 ,

(6.6)

with an, an−1 ∈ R and q ∈ R\{0, 1}. Given this recursive formation rule, one may infer the
explicit representation of a geometrical sequence as

an = a1qn−1 with n ∈ N.

(6.7)
Note that any geometrical sequence is uniquely determined by the two free parameters a1 and q,
the starting value of the sequence and the constant quotient between neighbours in the sequence,
respectively. Equation (6.7) shows that the elements an in a non-trivial geometrical sequence
exhibit either exponential growth or exponential decay with n (cf. Sec. 7.1.4).
When one calculates for a geometrical sequence of n + 1 real numbers the geometrical mean of
the immediate neighbours of any particular element an (with n ≥ 2), one ﬁnds that

√an−1 · an+1 =pa1qn−2 · a1qn = a1qn−1 = an .

Summation of the ﬁrst n elements of an arbitrary geometrical sequence of real numbers leads to
a ﬁnite geometrical series,

6.2. INTERESTANDCOMPOUNDINTEREST
6.2 Interest and compound interest

41

Let us consider a ﬁrst rather simple interest model. Suppose given an initial capital of positive
value K0 > 0 CU paid into a bank account at some initial instant, and a time interval consisting
of n ∈ N periods of equal lengths. At the end of each period, the money in this bank account
shall earn a service fee corresponding to an interest rate of p > 0 percent.
Introducing the
dimensionless interest factor2

q := 1 +

> 1 ,

(6.11)

p
100

one ﬁnds that by the end of the ﬁrst interest period a total capital of value (in CU)

K1 = K0 + K0 ·

p
100

= K0(cid:16)1 +

p

100(cid:17) = K0q

will have accumulated. When the entire time interval of n interest periods has ended, a ﬁnal
capital worth of (in CU)

recursively: Kn = Kn−1q ,

n ∈ N ,

(6.12)

will have accumulated, where Kn−1 denotes the capital (in CU) accumulated by the end of n − 1
interest periods. This recursive representation of the growth of the initial capital K0 due to a total
of n interest payments and the effect of compound interest makes explicit the direct link with the
mathematical structure of a geometrical sequence of real numbers (6.6).
It is a straightforward exercise to show that in this simple interest model the ﬁnal capital Kn is
related to the initial capital K0 by

explicitly: Kn = K0qn , n ∈ N .

(6.13)

Note that this equation links the four non-negative quantities Kn, K0, q and n to one another.
Hence, knowing the values of three of these quantities, one may solve Eq. (6.13) to obtain the
value of the fourth. For example, solving Eq. (6.13) for K0 yields

K0 =

Kn
qn =: B0 .

(6.14)

In this particular variant, K0 is referred to as the present value B0 of the ﬁnal capital Kn; this is
obtained from Kn by an n-fold division with the interest factor q.
Further possibilities of re-arranging Eq. (6.13) are:

(i) Solving for the interest factor q:

(ii) Solving for the contract period n:

q = nr Kn

CHAPTER6. ELEMENTARYFINANCIALMATHEMATICS
From now on, n ∈ N shall denote the number of full years that have passed in a speciﬁc interest
model.
Now we turn to discuss a second, more reﬁned interest model. Let us suppose that an initial
capital K0 > 0 CU earns interest during one full year m ∈ N times at the mth part of a nominal
annual interest rate pnom > 0. At the end of the ﬁrst out of m periods of equal length 1/m, the
initial capital K0 will thus have increased to an amount

K1/m = K0 + K0 ·

pnom
m · 100

= K0(cid:16)1 +

pnom

m · 100(cid:17) .

By the end of the kth (k ≤ m) out of m periods the account balance will have become

Kk/m = K0(cid:16)1 +

m · 100(cid:17)k

;

the interest factor(cid:16)1 +

m · 100(cid:17) will then have been applied k times to K0. At the end of the full

(6.19)

(6.20)

Finally, as a third interest model relevant to applications in Finance, we turn to consider the con-
cept of installment savings. For simplicity, let us restrict our discussion to the case when n ∈ N
equal installments of constant value E > 0 CU are paid into an account that earns p > 0 percent
annual interest (i.e., q > 1) at the beginning of each of n full years. The initial account balance

6.3. REDEMPTIONPAYMENTSINCONSTANTANNUITIES

be K0 = 0 CU. At the end of a ﬁrst full year in this interest model, the account balance will have
increased to

At the end of two full years one ﬁnds, substituting for K1,

K1 = E + E ·

p

= E(cid:16)1 +

p

100(cid:17) = Eq .

K2 = (K1 + E)q = (Eq + E)q = E(q2 + q) = Eq(q + 1) .

At the end of n full years we have, recursively substituting for Kn−1, Kn−2, etc.,

Kn = (Kn−1 + E)q = · · · = E(qn + . . . + q2 + q) = Eq(qn−1 + . . . + q + 1) = Eq

qk .

Using the identity (6.10), since presently q > 1, the account balance at the end of n full years can
be reduced to the expression

Kn = Eq

qn − 1
q − 1

,

q ∈ R>1 , n ∈ N .

(6.21)

The present value B0 associated with Kn is obtained by n-fold division of Kn with the interest
factor q:

B0 :=

Kn
qn

Eq. 6.21

z}|{= =

E(qn − 1)
qn−1(q − 1)

.

(6.22)

This gives the value of an initial capital B0 which will grow to the same ﬁnal value Kn after n
annual interest periods with constant interest factor q > 1.
Lastly, re-arranging Eq. (6.21) to solve for the contract period n yields.

n =

ln [1 + (q − 1)(Kn/Eq)]

ln(q)

.

(6.23)

6.3 Redemption payments in constant annuities

The starting point of the next discussion be a mortgage loan of amount R0 > 0 CU that an
economic agent borrowed from a bank at the obligation of annual service payments of p > 0
percent (i.e., q > 1) on the remaining debt. We suppose that the contract between the agent and
the bank ﬁxes the following conditions:

(i)

the ﬁrst redemption payment T1 amount to t > 0 percent of the mortgage R0,

(ii)

the remaining debt shall be paid back to the bank in constant annuities of value A > 0 CU
at the end of each full year that has passed.

The annuity A is deﬁned as the sum of the variable nth interest payment Zn > 0 CU and the
variable nth redemption payment Tn > 0 CU. In the present model we impose on the annuity
the condition that it be constant across full years,

A = Zn + Tn

!= constant .

(6.24)

44

CHAPTER6. ELEMENTARYFINANCIALMATHEMATICS

For n = 1, for example, we thus obtain

A = Z1 + T1 = R0 ·
For the ﬁrst full year of a running mortgage contract, the interest payment, the redemption payment,
and, following the payment of a ﬁrst annuity, the remaining debt take the values

+ R0 ·

= R0(cid:18) p + t

100 (cid:19) = R0(cid:20)(q − 1) +

At this stage, it has become clear according to which patterns the different quantities involved in
the redemption payment model need to be formed. The interest payment for the nth full year in a
mortgage contract of constant anuities amounts to (recursively)

Zn = Rn−1(q − 1) ,

n ∈ N ,

(6.26)

where Rn−1 denotes the remaining debt at the end of the previous full year. The redemption
payment for full year n is then given by (recursively)

The remaining debt at the end of the nth full year then is (in CU)

Tn = A − Zn , n ∈ N .

recursively: Rn = Rn−1 + Zn − A = Rn−1q − A , n ∈ N .

By successive backward substitution for Rn−1, Rn−2, etc., Rn can be re-expressed as

Rn = R0qn − A(qn−1 + . . . + q + 1) = R0qn − A

explicitly: Rn = R0qn − A

(6.27)

(6.28)

(6.29)

All the formulae we have now derived for computing the values of the quantities {n, Zn, Tn, Rn}
form the basis of a formal redemption payment plan, given by

a standard scheme that banks must make available to their mortgage customers for the purpose of
ﬁnancial orientation.

Remark: For known values of the free parameters R0 > 0 CU, q > 1 and A > 0 CU, the simple
recursive formulae (6.26), (6.27) and (6.28) can be used to implement a redemption payment plan
in a modern spreadsheet programme such as EXCEL or OpenOfﬁce.

We emphasise the following observation concerning Eq. (6.29): since the constant annuity A con-
tains implicitly a factor (q − 1) [cf. Eq. (6.25)], the two competing terms in this relation each grow
exponentially with n. For the redemption payments to eventually terminate, it is thus essential to
ﬁx the free parameter t (for known p > 0 ⇔ q > 1) in such a way that the second term on the
right-hand side of Eq. (6.29) is given the possibility to catch up with the ﬁrst as n progresses (the
latter of which has a head start of R0 > 0 CU at n = 0). The necessary condition following from
the requirement that Rn

!

≤ Rn−1 is thus t > 0.

Equation (6.29) links the ﬁve non-negative quantities Rn, R0, q, n and A to one another. Given
one knows the values of four of these, one can solve for the ﬁfth. For example:

(i) Calculation of the contract period n of a mortgage contract, knowing the mortgage R0, the
!= 0 imposed on Rn for n

interest factor q and the annuity A. Solving the condition Rn
yields (after a few algebraic steps)

n =

ln(cid:0)1 + p
t(cid:1)

ln(q)

;

(6.30)

the contract period is thus independent of the value of the mortgage loan, R0.

(ii) Evaluation of the annuity A, knowing the contract period n, the mortgage loan R0, and the

interest factor q. Solving the condition Rn

!= 0 imposed on Rn for A immediately yields

A =

qn(q − 1)
qn − 1

R0 .

(6.31)

Now equating the two expressions (6.31) and (6.25) for the annuity A, one ﬁnds in addition
that

qn − 1

6.4 Pension calculations

CHAPTER6. ELEMENTARYFINANCIALMATHEMATICS

Quantitative models for pension calculations assume given an initial capital K0 > 0 CU that
was paid into a bank account at a particular moment in time. The issue is to monitor the subse-
quent evolution in discrete time n of the account balance Kn (in CU), which is subjected to two
competing inﬂuences: on the one-hand side, the bank account earns interest at an annual interest
rate of p > 0 percent (i.e., q > 1), on the other, it is supposed that throughout one full year a total
of m ∈ N pension payments of the constant amount a are made from this bank account, always
at the beginning of each of m intervals of equal duration per year.
Let us begin by evaluating the amount of interest earned per year by the bank account. An impor-
tant point in this respect is the fact that throughout one full year there is a total of m deductions of
value a from the bank account, i.e., in general the account balance does not stay constant through-
out that year but rather decreases in discrete steps. For this reason, the account is credited by the
bank with interest only at the mth part of p > 0 percent for each interval (out of the total of m)
that has passed, with no compound interest effect. Hence, at the end of the ﬁrst out of m intervals
per year the bank account has earned interest worth of (in CU)

Z1/m = (K0 − a) ·

p

m · 100

= (K0 − a)

(q − 1)

m

.

The interest earned for the kth interval (out of m; k ≤ m) is then given by

Zk/m = (K0 − ka)

(q − 1)

m

.

Summation over the contributions of each of the m intervals to the interest earned then yields for
the entire interest earned during the ﬁrst full year (in CU)

Z1 =

By means of substitution from the identity (6.5), this result can be recast into the equivalent form

Z1 =(cid:20)K0 −

2

(m + 1)a(cid:21) (q − 1) .

(6.33)

Note that this quantity decreases linearly with the number of deductions m made per year resp. with
the pension payment amount a.
One now ﬁnds that the account balance at the end of the ﬁrst full year that has passed is given by

K1 = K0 − ma + Z1

Eq. (6.33)

z}|{= K0q −(cid:20)m +

At the end of a second full year of the pension payment contract the interest earned is

6.4. PENSIONCALCULATIONS

while the account balance amounts to

At this stage, certain fairly simple patterns for the interest earned during full year n, and the
account balance after n full years, reveal themselves. For Zn we have

(m + 1)(q − 1)(cid:21) a(q + 1) .

(m + 1)(q − 1)(cid:21) a

qn − 1
q − 1

, n, m ∈ N .

(6.35)

In a fashion practically identical to our discussion of the redemption payment model in Sec. 6.3,
the two competing terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (6.35) likewise exhibit exponential growth
with the number n of full years passed. Speciﬁcally, it depends on the values of the parameters
K0 > 0 CU, q > 1, a > 0 CU, as well as m ≥ 1, whether the second term eventually manages to
catch up with the ﬁrst as n progresses (the latter of which, in this model, is given a head start of
value K0 > 0 CU at n = 0).
We remark that Eq. (6.35), again, may be algebraically re-arranged at one’s convenience (as long
as division by zero is avoided). For example:

(i) The duration n (in full years) of a particular pension contract is obtained from solving the

condition Kn

!= 0 accordingly. Given that [. . .]a − K0(q − 1) > 0, one thus ﬁnds3

ln(cid:16)

[...]a

[...]a−K0(q−1)(cid:17)

n =

(6.36)

(ii) The present value B0 of a pension scheme results from the following consideration: for
ﬁxed interest factor q > 1, which initial capital K0 > 0 CU must be paid into a bank account
such that for a duration of n full years one can receive payments of constant amount a at the
beginning of each of m intervals (of equal length) per year? The value of B0 = K0 is again
!= 0 and solving for K0. This yields
obtained from imposing on Eq. (6.35) the condition Kn

(m + 1)(q − 1)(cid:21) a

CHAPTER6. ELEMENTARYFINANCIALMATHEMATICS

(iii) The idea of so-called everlasting pension payments of amount aever > 0 CU is based on the
strategy to consume only the annual interest earned by an initial capital K0 > 0 CU residing
in a bank account with interest factor q > 1. Imposing now on Eq. (6.35) the condition
Kn

!= K0 to hold for all values of n, and then solving for a, yields the result

aever =

Note that, naturally, aever is directly proportional to the initial capital K0!

6.5 Linear and declining-balance depreciation methods

Attempts at the quantitative description of the process of declining material value of industrial
goods, properties or other assets, of initial value K0 > 0 CU, are referred to as depreciation. In-
ternational tax laws generally provide investors with a choice between two particular mathematical
methods of calculating depreciation. We will discuss these options in turn.

6.5.1 Linear depreciation method
When the initial value K0 > 0 CU is supposed to decline to 0 CU in the space of N full years by
equal annual amounts, the remaining value Rn (in CU) at the end of n full years is described by

Rn = K0 − n(cid:18)K0

N (cid:19) , n = 1, . . . , N .

(6.39)

Note that for the difference of remaining values for years adjacent one obtains Rn − Rn−1 =
N (cid:19) =: d < 0. The underlying mathematical structure of the straight line depreciation
−(cid:18)K0

method is thus an arithmetical sequence of real numbers, with constant negative difference d
between neighbouring elements (cf. Sec. 6.1.1).

6.5.2 Declining-balance depreciation method

The foundation of the second depreciation method to be described here, for an industrial good of
initial value K0 > 0 CU, is the idea that per year the value declines by a certain percentage rate
p > 0 of the value of the good during the previous year. Introducing a dimensionless depreciation
factor by

q := 1 −

p
100

< 1 ,

the remaining value Rn (in CU) after n full years amounts to

recursively: Rn = Rn−1q , R0 ≡ K0 , n ∈ N .

The underlying mathematical structure of the declining balance depreciation method is thus a
geometrical sequence of real numbers, with constant ratio 0 < q < 1 between neighbouring

(6.40)

(6.41)

6.6. SUMMARISINGFORMULA

49

elements (cf. Sec. 6.1.2). With increasing n the values of these elements become ever smaller. By
means of successive backward substitution expression (6.41) can be transformed to

explicitly: Rn = K0qn ,

0 < q < 1 , n ∈ N .

(6.42)

From Eq. (6.42), one may derive results concerning the following questions of a quantitative na-
ture:

(i) Suppose given a depreciation factor q and a projected remaining value Rn for some industrial

good. After which depreciation period n will this value be attained? One ﬁnds

n =

ln (Rn/K0)

ln(q)

.

(6.43)

(ii) Knowing a projected depreciation period n and corresponding remaining value Rn, at which

percentage rate p > 0 must the depreciation method be operated? This yields

q = nr Rn
6.6 Summarising formula

K0 ⇒ p = 100 · 1 − nr Rn
K0! .

(6.44)

To conclude this chapter, let us summarise the results on elementary ﬁnancial mathematics that
we derived along the way. Remarkably, these can be condensed in a single formula which contains
the different concepts discussed as special cases. This formula, in which n represents the number
of full years that have passed, is given by (cf. Zeh–Marschke (2010) [26]):

Differential calculus of real-valued
functions of one real variable

In Chs. 1 to 5 of these lecture notes, we conﬁned our considerations to functional relationships
between INPUT quantities and OUTPUT quantities of a linear nature. In this chapter now, we
turn to discuss characteristic properties of truly non-linear functional relationships between one
INPUT quantity and one OUTPUT quantity.

7.1 Real-valued functions of one real variable

Let us begin by introducing the concept of a real-valued function of one real variable. This
constitutes a special kind of a mapping1 that needs to satisfy the following simple but very strict
rule:

a mapping f that assigns to every element x from a subset D of the real numbers R (i.e.,
D ⊆ R) one and only one element y from a second subset W of the real numbers R (i.e., W ⊆ R).
Def.: A unique mapping f of a subset D ⊆ R of the real numbers onto a subset W ⊆ R of the
real numbers,
(7.1)

is referred to as a real-valued function of one real variable.

f : D → W ,

x 7→ y = f (x)

We now ﬁx some terminology concerning the concept of a real-valued function of one real variable:

• D: domain of f,
• W : target space of f,
• x ∈ D: independent variable of f, also referred to as the argument of f,
• y ∈ W : dependent variable of f,
1Cf. our introduction in Ch. 2 of matrices as a particular class of mathematical objects.

51

52

CHAPTER7. DIFFERENTIALCALCULUSOFREAL-VALUEDFUNCTIONS

• f (x): mapping prescription,
• graph of f: the set of pairs of values G = {(x, f (x))|x ∈ D} ⊆ R2.

For later analysis of the mathematical properties of real-valued functions of one real variable, we
need to address a few more technical issues.
Def.: Given a mapping f that is one-to-one and onto, with domain D(f ) ⊆ R and target space
W (f ) ⊆ R, not only is every x ∈ D(f ) assigned to one and only one y ∈ W (f ), but also every
y ∈ W (f ) is assigned to one and only one x ∈ D(f ). In this case, there exists an associated
mapping f −1, with D(f −1) = W (f ) and W (f −1) = D(f ), which is referred to as the inverse
function of f.
Def.: A real-valued function f of one real variable x is continuous at some value x ∈ D(f ) when
for ∆x ∈ R>0 the condition

lim
∆x→0

f (x − ∆x) = lim

∆x→0

f (x + ∆x) = f (x)

(7.2)

obtains, i.e., when at x the left and right limits of the function f coincide and are equal to the value
f (x). A real-valued function f as such is continuous when f is continuous for all x ∈ D(f ).
Def.: When a real-valued function f of one real variable x satisﬁes the condition

f (a) < f (b)

for all a, b ∈ D(f ) with a < b ,

then f is called strictly monotonously increasing. When, however, f satisﬁes the condition

f (a) > f (b)

for all a, b ∈ D(f ) with a < b ,

(7.3)

(7.4)

then f is called strictly monotonously decreasing.
Note, in particular, that real-valued functions of one real variable that are strictly monotonous and
continous are always one-to-one and onto and, therefore, are invertible.

In the following, we brieﬂy review ﬁve elementary classes of real-valued functions of one real vari-
able that ﬁnd frequent application in the modelling of quantitative problems in economic theory.

7.1.1 Polynomials of degree n
Polynomials of degree n are real-valued functions of one real variable of the form

y = f (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + . . . + aixi + . . . + a2x2 + a1x + a0

(7.5)

with ai ∈ R, i = 1, . . . , n, n ∈ N, an 6= 0 .

Their domain comprises the entire set of real numbers, i.e., D(f ) = R. The extent of their target
space depends speciﬁcally on the values of the real constant coefﬁcients ai ∈ R. Functions in this
class possess a maximum of n real roots.

7.1. REAL-VALUEDFUNCTIONS
7.1.2 Rational functions
Rational functions are constructed by forming the ratio of two polynomials of degrees m resp. n,
i.e.,

53

y = f (x) =

pm(x)
qn(x)

=

amxm + . . . + a1x + a0
bnxn + . . . + b1x + b0

(7.6)

with ai, bj ∈ R, i = 1, . . . , m, j = 1, . . . , n, m, n ∈ N, am, bn 6= 0 .

Their domain is given by D(f ) = R\{x|qn(x) = 0}. When for the degrees m and n of the
polynomials pm(x) and qn(x) we have

(i) m < n, then f is referred to as a proper rational function, or
(ii) m ≥ n, then f is referred to as an improper rational function.
In the latter case, application of polynomial division leads to a separation of f into a purely poly-
nomial part and a proper rational part. The roots of f always correspond to those roots of the
numerator polynomial pm(x) for which simultaneously qn(x) 6= 0 applies. The roots of the de-
nominator polynomial qn(x) constitute poles of f. Proper rational functions always tend for very
small (i.e., x → −∞) and for very large (i.e., x → +∞) values of their argument to zero.
7.1.3 Power-law functions

Power-law functions exhibit the speciﬁc structure given by

y = f (x) = xα with α ∈ R .

(7.7)

We here conﬁne ourselves to cases with domains D(f ) = R>0, such that for the coresponding
target spaces we have W (f ) = R>0. Under these conditions, power-law functions are strictly
monotonously increasing when α > 0, and strictly monotonously decreasing when α < 0. Hence,
they are inverted by y = α√x = x1/α. There do not exist any roots under the conditions stated here.

7.1.4 Exponential functions

Exponential functions have the general form

y = f (x) = ax with a ∈ R>0\{1} .

(7.8)

Their domain is D(f ) = R, while their target space is W (f ) = R>0. They exhibit strict
monotonous increase for a > 1, and strict monotonous decrease for 0 < a < 1. Hence, they
too are invertible. Their y-intercept is generally located at y = 1. For a > 1, exponential functions
are also known as growth functions.
Special case: When the constant (!) base number is chosen to be a = e, where e denotes the
irrational Euler’s number (according to the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, 1707–1783)
deﬁned by the inﬁnite series

e :=

one obtains the natural exponential function

7.1.5 Logarithmic functions

Logarithmic functions, denoted by

y = f (x) = loga(x) with a ∈ R>0\{1} ,

(7.10)

are deﬁned as inverse functions of the strictly monotonous exponential functions y = f (x) = ax
— and vice versa. Correspondingly, D(f ) = R>0 and W (f ) = R apply. Strictly monotonously
increasing behaviour is given when a > 1, strictly monotonously decreasing behaviour when
0 < a < 1. In general, the x-intercept is located at x = 1.

Special case: The natural logarithmic function (lat.:
constant basis number is set to a = e. This yields

logarithmus naturalis) obtains when the

y = f (x) = loge(x) := ln(x) .

(7.11)

7.1.6 Concatenations of real-valued functions

Real-valued functions from all ﬁve categories considered in the previous sections may be combined
arbitrarily (respecting relevant computational rules), either via the four fundamental arithmetical
operations, or via concatenations.

Theorem: Let real-valued functions f and g be continuous on domains D(f ) resp. D(g). Then
the combined real-valued functions

1. sum/difference f ± g, where (f ± g)(x) := f (x) ± g(x) with D(f ) ∩ D(g),
2. product f · g, where (f · g)(x) := f (x)g(x) with D(f ) ∩ D(g),
3. quotient f
g

with g(x) 6= 0 and D(f ) ∩ D(g)\{x|g(x) = 0},

f (x)

, where(cid:18)f

g(cid:19) (x) :=

4. concatenation f ◦ g, where (f ◦ g)(x) := f (g(x)) mit {x ∈ D(g)|g(x) ∈ D(f )},

are also continuous on the respective domains.

7.2. DERIVATIONOFDIFFERENTIABLEREAL-VALUEDFUNCTIONS
7.2 Derivation of differentiable real-valued functions

55

The central theme of this chapter is the mathematical description of the local variability of con-
tinuous real-valued function of one real variable, f : D ⊆ R → W ⊆ R. To this end, let
us consider the effect on f of a small change of its argument x. Supposing we affect a change
x → x + ∆x, with ∆x ∈ R, what are the resultant consequences for f? We immediately ﬁnd that
y → y + ∆y = f (x + ∆x), with ∆y ∈ R, obtains. Hence, a prescribed change of the argument x
by a (small) value ∆x triggers in f a change by the amount ∆y = f (x + ∆x) − f (x). It is of
general quantitative interest to compare the sizes of these two changes. This is accomplished by
forming the respective difference quotient

∆y
∆x

=

f (x + ∆x) − f (x)

∆x

.

It is then natural, for given f, to investigate the limit behaviour of this difference quotient as the
change ∆x of the argument of f is made successively smaller.
Def.: A continuous real-valued function f of one real variable is called differentiable at
x ∈ D(f ), when for arbitrary ∆x ∈ R the limit

f ′(x) := lim
∆x→0

∆y
∆x

= lim
∆x→0

f (x + ∆x) − f (x)

∆x

(7.12)

exists and is unique. When f is differentiable for all x ∈ D(f ), then f as such is referred to as
being differentiable.
The existence of this limit in a point (x, f (x)) for a real-valued function f requires that the latter
exhibits neither “jumps” nor “kinks,” i.e., that at (x, f (x)) the function is sufﬁciently “smooth.”
The quantity f ′(x) is referred to as the ﬁrst derivative of the (differentiable) function f at posi-
tion x. It provides a quantitative measure for the local rate of change of the function f in the
point (x, f (x)). In general one interprets the ﬁrst derivative f ′(x) as follows: an increase of the
argument x of a differentiable real-valued function f by 1 (one) unit leads to a change in the value
of f by approximately f ′(x) · 1 units.
Alternative notation for the ﬁrst derivative of f:

f ′(x) ≡

df (x)

dx

.

The differential calculus was developed in parallel with the integral calculus (see Ch. 7) during the
second half of the 17th Century, independent of one another by the English physicist, mathemat-
iccian, astronomer and philosopher Sir Isaac Newton (1643–1727) and the German philosopher,
mathematician and physicist Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716).
Via the ﬁrst derivative of a differentiable function f at an argument x0 ∈ D(f ), i.e., f ′(x0), one
deﬁnes the so-called linearisation of f in a neighbourhood of x0. The equation describing the
associated tangent to f in the point (x0, f (x0)) is given by

y = f (x0) + f ′ (x0)(x − x0) .

(7.13)

56

CHAPTER7. DIFFERENTIALCALCULUSOFREAL-VALUEDFUNCTIONS

GDC: Local values f ′(x0) of ﬁrst derivatives can be computed for given function f in mode CALC
using the interactive routine dy/dx.

The following rules of differentiation apply for the ﬁve families of elementary real-valued functions
discussed in Sec. 7.1, as well as concatenations thereof:
Rules of differentiation

1. (c)′ = 0 for c = constant ∈ R
2. (x)′ = 1
3. (xn)′ = nxn−1 for n ∈ N
4. (xα)′ = αxα−1 for α ∈ R and x ∈ R>0
5. (ax)′ = ln(a)ax for a ∈ R>0\{1}
6. (eax)′ = aeax for a ∈ R

1

x ln(a)

for a ∈ R>0\{1} and x ∈ R>0

8. (ln(x))′ =

For differentiable real-valued functions f and g it holds that:

1. (cf (x))′ = cf ′(x) for c = constant ∈ R
2. (f (x) ± g(x))′ = f ′(x) ± g′(x)
3. (f (x)g(x))′ = f ′(x)g(x) + f (x)g′(x)

The methods of differential calculus just introduced shall now be employed to describe the local
change behaviour of a few simple examples of functions in economic theory, and also to deter-
mine their local extremal values. The following section provides an overview of such frequently
occurring economic functions.

The fundamental concept of a utility function as a means to capture in quantitative terms
the psychological value (happiness) assigned by an economic agent to a certain amount
of money, or to owning a speciﬁc good, was introduced to economic theory in 1738 by
the Swiss mathematician and physicist Daniel Bernoulli FRS (1700–1782); cf. Bernoulli
(1738) [4]. The utility function is part of the folklore of the theory, and often taken to be
a piecewise differentiable, right-handedly curved (concave) function, i.e., U ′′(x) < 0, on
the grounds of the assumption of diminishing marginal utility (happiness) with increasing
material wealth.

CHAPTER7. DIFFERENTIALCALCULUSOFREAL-VALUEDFUNCTIONS

A particularly prominent example of a real-valued economic function of one real variable
constitutes the psychological value function, devised by the Israeli–US-American experi-
mental psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (1937–1996) in the context of
their Prospect Theory (a pillar of Behavioural Economics), which was later awarded a
Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel in 2002 (cf. Kahne-
man and Tversky (1979) [18, p 279], and Kahneman (2011) [17, p 282f]). A possible representa-
tion of this function is given by the piecewise description

with parameter a ∈ R>0. Overcoming a conceptual problem of Bernoulli’s utility function, here,
in contrast, the argument x quantiﬁes a change in wealth (or welfare) with respect to some given
reference point (rather than a speciﬁc value of wealth itself).

7.4 Curve sketching

Before we turn to discuss applications of differential calculus to simple quantitative problems
in economic theory, we brieﬂy summarize the main steps of curve sketching for a real-valued
function of one real variable, also referred to as analysis of the properties of differentiability of a
real-valued function.

1. domain: D(f ) = {x ∈ R|f (x) is regular}
2. symmetries: for all x ∈ D(f ), is

(i) f (−x) = f (x), i.e., is f even, or
(ii) f (−x) = −f (x), i.e., is f odd, or
(iii) f (−x) 6= f (x) 6= −f (x), i.e., f exhibits no symmetries?

3. roots: identify all xN ∈ D(f ) that satisfy the condition f (x) != 0.
4. local extremal values:

(i) local minima of f exist at all xE ∈ D(f ), for which the

necessary condition f ′(x) != 0, and the

sufﬁcient condition f ′′(x)

!
> 0 are satisﬁed simultaneously.

(ii) local maxima of f exist at all xE ∈ D(f ), for which the

necessary condition f ′(x) != 0, and the

sufﬁcient condition f ′′(x)

!
< 0 are satisﬁed simultaneously.

7.5. ANALYTICINVESTIGATIONSOFECONOMICFUNCTIONS

5. points of inﬂection: ﬁnd all xW ∈ D(f ), for which the

necessary condition f ′′(x) != 0, and the

sufﬁcient condition f ′′′(x)

6. monotonous behaviour:

!

6= 0 are satisﬁed simultaneously.

(i) f is monotonously increasing for all x ∈ D(f ) with f ′(x) > 0
(ii) f is monotonously decreasing for all x ∈ D(f ) with f ′(x) < 0

7. local curvature:

(i) f behaves left-handedly curved for x ∈ D(f ) with f ′′(x) > 0
(ii) f behaves right-handedly curved for x ∈ D(f ) with f ′′(x) < 0

8. asymptotic behaviour:

asymptotes to f are constituted by
(i) straight lines y = ax + b with the property limx→+∞[f (x) − ax − b] = 0 or

limx→−∞[f (x) − ax − b] = 0

(ii) straight lines x = x0 at poles x0 /∈ D(f )

9. range: W (f ) = {y ∈ R|y = f (x)}.

7.5 Analytic investigations of economic functions

7.5.1 Total cost functions according to Turgot and von Th¨unen
According to the law of diminishing returns, which was introduced to economic theory by the
French economist and statesman Anne Robert Jacques Turgot (1727–1781) and also by the Ger-
man economist Johann Heinrich von Th¨unen (1783–1850), it is meaningful to model non-negative
total cost functions K(x) (in CU) relating to typical production processes, with argument level
of physical output x ≥ 0 units, as a mathematical mapping in terms of a special polynomial of
degree 3 [cf. Eq. (7.5)], which is given by

K(x) = a3x3 + a2x2 + a1x

+ a0

|{z}=Kf
}
with a3, a1 > 0, a2 < 0, a0 ≥ 0, a2
2 − 3a3a1 < 0 .

{z

=Kv(x)

|

(7.15)

The model thus contains a total of four free parameters. It is the outcome of a systematic regres-
sion analysis of agricultural quantitative–empirical data with the aim to describe an inherently
non-linear functional relationship between a few economic variables. As such, the functional
relationship for K(x) expressed in Eq. (7.15) was derived from a practical consideration. It is a
reﬂection of the following observed features:

60

(i)

CHAPTER7. DIFFERENTIALCALCULUSOFREAL-VALUEDFUNCTIONS
for levels of physical output x ≥ 0 units, the total costs relating to typical production
processes exhibit strictly monotonously increasing behaviour; thus

(ii)

for the total costs there do not exist neither roots nor local extremal values;2 however,

(iii)

the total costs display exactly one point of inﬂection.

The continuous curve for K(x) resulting from these considerations exhibits the characteristic shape
of an inverted capital letter “S”: beginning at a positive value corresponding to ﬁxed costs, the total
costs ﬁrst increase degressively up to a point of inﬂection, whereafter they continue to increase,
but in a progressive fashion.

In broad terms, the functional expression given in Eq. (7.15) to model totals costs in dependence
of the level of physical output is the sum of two contributions, the variable costs Kv(x) and the
ﬁxed costs Kf = a0, viz.

K(x) = Kv(x) + Kf .

(7.16)

In economic theory, it is commonplace to partition total cost functions in the diminishing returns
picture into four phases, the boundaries of which are designated by special values of the level of
physical output of a production process:

• phase I (interval 0 units ≤ x ≤ xW ):

the total costs K(x) possess at a level of physical output xW = −a2/(3a3) > 0 units a
point of inﬂection. For values of x smaller than xW , one obtains K ′′(x) < 0 CU/unit2, i.e.,
K(x) increases in a degressive fashion. For values of x larger than xW , the opposite applies,
K ′′(x) > 0 CU/unit2, i.e., K(x) increases in a progressive fashion. The marginal costs,
given by

K ′(x) = 3a3x2 + 2a2x + a1 > 0 CU/unit

for all x ≥ 0 units ,

(7.17)

attain a minimum at the same level of physical output, xW = −a2/(3a3).

• phase II (interval xW < x ≤ xg1):

the variable average costs

Kv(x)

x

= a3x2 + a2x + a1 ,

x > 0 units

(7.18)

become minimal at a level of physical output xg1 = −a2/(2a3) > 0 units. At this value
of x, equality of variable average costs and marginal costs applies, i.e.,

Kv(x)

x

= K ′(x) ,

(7.19)

2The last condition in Eq. (7.15) ensures a ﬁrst derivative of K(x) that does not possess any roots; cf. the case of

a quadratic algebraic equation 0

!

= ax2 + bx + c, with discriminant b2 − 4ac < 0.

which follows by the quotient rule of differentiation from the necessary condition for an

and the fact that K ′

f = 0 CU/unit. Taking care of the equality (7.19), one ﬁnds for the tangent

T (x) = K(xg1)+K ′(xg1)(x−xg1) = Kv(xg1)+Kf +
Its intercept with the K-axis is at Kf .

is given by 0 CU != 2a3x3
g2 − a0. At this value of x, equality of average costs and
marginal costs obtains, viz.

g2 + a2x2

K(x)

x

= K ′(x) ,

(7.21)

which follows by the quotient rule of differentiation from the necessary condition for an
extremum of the average costs,

0 !=(cid:18) K(x)
x (cid:19)′

=

K ′(x) · x − K(x) · 1

x2

.

Since a quotient can be zero only when its numerator vanishes (and its denominator remains
non-zero), one ﬁnds from re-arranging the numerator expression equated to zero the property

K ′(x)
K(x)/x

= x

K ′(x)
K(x)

= 1

for x = xg2 .

(7.22)

The corresponding extremal value pair (xg2, K(xg2)) is referred to in economic theory as the
minimum efﬁcient scale (MES). From a business economics perspective, at a level of phys-
ical output x = xg2 the (compared to our remarks in the Introduction inverted) ratio “INPUT

Its intercept with the K-axis is thus at 0 CU.

• phase IV (half-interval x > xg2):

In this phase K ′(x)/K(x)/x > 1 obtains; the costs associated with the production of one
additional unit of a good, approximately the marginal costs K ′(x), now exceed the aver-
age costs, K(x)/x. This situation is considered unfavourable from a business economics
perspective.

7.5.2 Proﬁt functions in the diminishing returns picture

In this section, we conﬁne our considerations, for reasons of simplicity, to a market sitution with
only a single supplier of a good in demand. The price policy that this single supplier may thus
inact deﬁnes a state of monopoly. Moreover, in addition we want to assume that for the market
situation considered economic equilibrium obtains. This manifests itself in equality of supply
and demand, viz.

x(p) = N(p) ,

(7.23)

wherein x denotes a non-negative supply function (in units) (which is synonymous with the sup-
plier’s level of physical output) and N a non-negative demand function (in units), both of which
are taken to depend on the positive unit price p (in CU/unit) of the good in question. The supply
function, and with it the unit price, can, of course, be prescribed by the monopolistic supplier in
an arbitrary fashion. In a speciﬁc quantitative economic model, for instance, the demand func-
tion x(p) (recall that by Eq. (7.23) x(p) = N(p) obtains) could be assumed to be either a linear or
a quadratic function of p. In any case, in order for x(p) to realistically describe an actual demand–
unit price relationship, it should be chosen as a strictly monotonously decreasing function, and as
such it is invertible. The non-negative demand function x(p) features two characteristic points,
signiﬁed by its intercepts with the x- and the p-axes. The prohibitive price pproh is to be deter-
mined from the condition x(pproh) != 0 units; therefore, it constitutes a root of x(p). The saturation
quantity xsat, on the other hand, is deﬁned by xsat := x(0 CU/unit).

The inverse function associated with the strictly monotonously decreasing non-negative demand
function x(p), the unit price function p(x) (in CU/unit), is likewise strictly monotonously
decreasing. Via p(x), one calculates,
in dependence on a known amount x of units sup-
plied/demanded (i.e., sold), the total revenue (in CU) made by a monopolist according to (cf.
Sec. 7.3)

E(x) = xp(x) .

(7.24)

Under the assumption that the non-negative total costs K(x) (in CU) underlying the production
process of the good in demand can be modelled according to the diminishing returns picture of
Turgot and von Th¨unen, the proﬁt function (in CU) of the monopolist in dependence on the level
of physical output takes the form

The ﬁrst two derivatives of G(x) with respect to its argument x are given by

G′(x) = E ′(x) − K ′(x) = xp′(x) + p(x) −(cid:2)3a3x2 + 2a2x + a1(cid:3)
G′′(x) = E ′′(x) − K ′′(x) = xp′′(x) + 2p′(x) − [6a3x + 2a2] .

(7.26)
(7.27)

Employing the principles of curve sketching set out in Sec. 7.4, the following characteristic values
of G(x) can thus be identiﬁed:

• break-even point

xS > 0 units, as the unique solution to the conditions

G(x) != 0 CU

(necessary condition)

and

G′(x)

!
> 0 CU/unit

(sufﬁcient condition) ,

• end of the proﬁtable zone

xG > 0 units, as the unique solution to the conditions

G(x) != 0 CU

(necessary condition)

and

G′(x)

!
< 0 CU/unit

(sufﬁcient condition) ,

• maximum proﬁt

xM > 0 CU, as the unique solution to the conditions

G′(x) != 0 CU/unit

(necessary condition)

and

(sufﬁcient condition) .

(7.31)

(7.32)

(7.33)

At this point, we like to draw the reader’s attention to a special geometric property of the quan-
titative model for proﬁt that we just have outlined: at maximum proﬁt, the total revenue func-
tion E(x) and the total cost function K(x) always possess parallel tangents. This is due to the
fact that by the necessary condition for an extremum to exist, one ﬁnds that

0 CU/unit != G′(x) = E ′(x) − K ′(x)

⇔

E ′(x) != K ′(x) .

(7.34)

GDC: Roots and local maxima resp. minima can be easily determined for a given stored function
in mode CALC by employing the interactive routines zero and maximum resp. minimum.
To conclude these considerations, we brieﬂy turn to elucidate the technical term Cournot’s point,
which frequently arises in quantitative discussions in economic theory; this is named after the
French mathematician and economist Antoine–Augustin Cournot (1801–1877). Cournot’s point

64

CHAPTER7. DIFFERENTIALCALCULUSOFREAL-VALUEDFUNCTIONS

simply labels the proﬁt-optimal combination of the level of physical output and the associated unit
price, (xM , p(xM )), for the unit price function p(x) of a good in a monopolistic market situation.
Note that for this speciﬁc combination of optimal values the Amoroso–Robinson formula applies,
which was developed by the Italian mathematician and economist Luigi Amoroso (1886–1965)
and the British economist Joan Violet Robinson (1903–1983). This states that

p(xM ) =

K ′(xM )

1 + εp(xM )

,

(7.35)

with K ′(xM ) the value of the marginal costs at xM , and εp(xM ) the value of the elasticity of the
unit price function at xM (see the following Sec. 7.6). Starting from the deﬁning equation of the
total revenue E(x) = xp(x), the Amoroso–Robinson formula is derived by evaluating the ﬁrst
derivative of E(x) at xM , so

E ′(xM ) = p(xM ) + xM p′(xM ) = p(xM )(cid:20)1 + xM

p′(xM )

p(xM )(cid:21) Sec. 7.6

z}|{= = p(xM ) [1 + εp(xM )] ,

and then re-arranging to solve for p(xM ), using the fact that E ′(xM ) = K ′(xM ).
Remark: In a market situation where perfect competition applies, one assumes that the unit
price function has settled to a constant value p(x) = p = constant > 0 CU/unit (and, hence,
p′(x) = 0 CU/unit2 obtains).

7.5.3 Extremal values of rational economic functions

Now we want to address the determination of extremal values of economic functions that constitute
ratios in the sense of the construction

OUTPUT
INPUT

,

a topic raised in the Introduction.
Let us consider two examples for determining local maxima of ratios of this kind.

(i) We begin with the average proﬁt in dependence on the level of physical output x ≥ 0 units,
(7.36)

G(x)

.

x

The conditions that determine a local maximum are [G(x)/x]′
[G(x)/x]′′
the ﬁrst condition yields

!= 0 CU/unit2 and
!
< 0 CU/unit3. Respecting the quotient rule of differentiation (cf. Sec. 7.2),

G′(x)x − G(x)

x2

= 0 GE/ME2 .

(7.37)

Since a quotient can only be zero when its numerator vanishes while its denominator remains
non-zero, it immediately follows that

G′(x)x − G(x) = 0 CU ⇒ x

G′(x)
G(x)

= 1 .

(7.38)

7.6. ELASTICITIES

65

The task at hand now is to ﬁnd a (unique) value of the level of physical output x which
satisﬁes this last condition, and for which the second derivative of the average proﬁt becomes
negative.

(ii) To compare the performance of two companies over a given period of time in a meaningful
way, it is recommended to adhere only to measures that are dimensionless ratios, and so
independent of scale. An example of such a dimensionless ratio is the measure referred to
as economic efﬁciency,

W (x) =

E(x)
K(x)

,

(7.39)

which expresses the total revenue (in CU) of a company for a given period as a multiple of
the total costs (in CU) it had to endure during this period, both as functions of the level of
physical output. In analogy to our discussion in (i), the conditions for the existence of a
< 0 × 1/unit2.
local maximum amount to [E(x)/K(x)]′
By the quotient rule of differentiation (see Sec. 7.2), the ﬁrst condition leads to

!= 0 × 1/unit and [E(x)/K(x)]′′

!

i.e., for K(x) > 0 CU,

E ′(x)K(x) − E(x)K ′(x)

K 2(x)

= 0 × 1/unit ,

E ′(x)K(x) − E(x)K ′(x) = 0 CU2/unit .

(7.40)

(7.41)

By re-arranging and multiplication with x > 0 unit, this can be cast into the particular form

x

E ′(x)
E(x)

= x

K ′(x)
K(x)

.

(7.42)

The reason for this special kind of representation of the necessary condition for a local
maximum to exist [and also for Eq. (7.38)] will be clariﬁed in the subsequent section. Again,
a value of the level of physical output which satisﬁes Eq. (7.42) must in addition lead to
a negative second derivative of the economic efﬁciency in order to satisfy the sufﬁcient
condition for a local maximum to exist.

7.6 Elasticities

Finally, we pick up once more the discussion on quantifying the local variability of differentiable
real-valued functions of one real variable, f : D ⊆ R → W ⊆ R, though from a slightly different
perspective. For reasons to be elucidated shortly, we conﬁne ourselves to considerations of regimes
of f with positive values of the argument x and also positive values y = f (x) > 0 of the function
itself.
As before in Sec. 7.2, we want to assume a small change of the value of the argument x and
evaluate its resultant effect on the value y = f (x). This yields

x ∆x∈R

−→ x + ∆x

=⇒

y = f (x)

∆y∈R

−→ y + ∆y = f (x + ∆x) .

(7.43)

66

CHAPTER7. DIFFERENTIALCALCULUSOFREAL-VALUEDFUNCTIONS

We remark in passing that relative changes of non-negative quantities are deﬁned by the quotient

new value − old value

old value

under the prerequisite that “old value > 0” applies. It follows from this speciﬁc construction that
the minimum value a relative change can possibly attain amounts to “−1” (corresponding to a
decrease of the “old value” by 100%).

Related to this consideration we identify the following terms:

• a prescribed absolute change of the independent variable x:
• the resultant absolute change of the function f:
• the associated relative change of the independent variable x:

∆y = f (x + ∆x) − f (x) ,

∆x ,

∆x
x

,

• the associated resultant relative change of the function f:

∆y
y

=

f (x + ∆x) − f (x)

f (x)

.

Now let us compare the order-of-magnitudes of the two relative changes just envisaged,
∆y
y
divided by the prescribed relative change of x”’:

. This is realised by considering the value of their quotient, “resultant relative change of f

∆x

and

∆y
y

=

f (x + ∆x) − f (x)

f (x)

.

Since we assumed f to be differentiable, it is possible to investigate the behaviour of this quotient
∆x
of relative changes in the limit of increasingly smaller prescribed relative changes
x → 0 ⇒
∆x → 0 near some x > 0. One thus deﬁnes:
Def.: For a differentiable real-valued function f of one real variable x, the dimensionless (i.e.,
units-independent) quantity

εf (x) := lim
∆x→0

f (x)

f ′(x)
f (x)

(7.44)

is referred to as the elasticity of the function f at position x.
The elasticity of f quantiﬁes its resultant relative change in response to a prescribed inﬁnitesimally
small relative change of its argument x, starting from some positive initial value x > 0. As such it
constitutes a measure for the relative local rate of change of a function f in a point (x, f (x)). In

7.6. ELASTICITIES

67

economic theory, in particular, one adheres to the following interpretation of the elasticity εf (x):
when the postive argument x of some positive differentiable real-valued function f is increased by
1 %, then in consequence f will change approximately by εf (x) × 1 %.
In the scientiﬁc literature one often ﬁnds the elasticity of a positive differentiable function f of a
positive argument x expressed in terms of logarithmic differentiation. That is,

εf (x) :=

d ln[f (x)]

d ln(x)

for x > 0 and f (x) > 0 ,

since by the chain rule of differentiation it holds that

d ln[f (x)]

d ln(x)

=

df (x)
f (x)
dx
x

df (x)

dx
f (x)

f ′(x)

.

The logarithmic representation of the elasticity of a differentiable function f immediately explains
why, at the beginning, we conﬁned our considerations to positive differentiable functions of posi-
tive arguments only.3 A brief look at the list of standard economic functions provided in Sec. 7.3
reveals that most of these (though not all) are positive functions of non-negative arguments.

For the elementary classes of real-valued functions of one real variable discussed in Sec. 7.1 one
ﬁnds:
Standard elasticities

1. f (x) = xn for n ∈ N and x ∈ R>0 ⇒ εf (x) = n
2. f (x) = xα for α ∈ R and x ∈ R>0 ⇒ εf (x) = α
3. f (x) = ax for a ∈ R>0\{1} and x ∈ R>0 ⇒ εf (x) = ln(a)x
4. f (x) = eax for a ∈ R and x ∈ R>0 ⇒ εf (x) = ax
5. f (x) = loga(x) for a ∈ R>0\{1} and x ∈ R>0

(logarithmic functions)

6. f (x) = ln(x) for x ∈ R>0 ⇒ εf (x) =

ln(x)

(natural logarithmic function).

In view of these results, we would like to emphasise the fact that for the entire family of gen-
eral power-law functions the elasticity εf (x) has a constant value, independent of the value of
the argument x. It is this very property which classiﬁes general power-law functions as scale-
invariant. When scale-invariance obtains, dimensionless ratios, i.e., quotients of variables of the
3To extend the regime of applicability of the measure εf , one may consider working in terms of absolute values |x|
and |f (x)|. Then one has to distinguish between four cases, which need to be looked at separately: (i) x > 0, f (x) > 0,
(ii) x < 0, f (x) > 0, (iii) x < 0, f (x) < 0 and (iv) x > 0, f (x) < 0.

CHAPTER7. DIFFERENTIALCALCULUSOFREAL-VALUEDFUNCTIONS

same physical dimension, reduce to constants. In this context, we would like to remark that scale-
invariant (fractal) power-law functions of the form f (x) = Kxα, with K > 0 and α ∈ R<0\{−1},
are frequently employed in Economics and the Social Sciences for modelling uncertainty of eco-
nomic agents in decision-making processes, or for describing probability distributions of rare
event phenomena; see, e.g., Taleb (2007) [25, p 326ff] or Gleick (1987) [13, Chs. 5 and 6]. This
is due, in part, to the curious property that for certain values of the exponent α general power-law
probability distributions attain unbounded variance; cf. Ref. [12, Sec. 8.9].
Practical applications in economic theory of the concept of an elasticty as a measure of relative
change of a differentiable real-valued function f of one real variable x are generally based on the
following linear (!) approximation: beginning at x0 > 0, for small prescribed percentage changes
∆x
of the argument x in the interval 0 % <
x0 ≤ 5 %, the resultant percentage changes of f amount
approximately to

(percentage change of f ) ≈ (elasticity of f at x0) × (percentage change of x) ,

(7.45)

or, in terms of a mathematical formula, to

f (x0 + ∆x) − f (x0)

f (x0)

≈ εf (x0)

∆x
x0

.

(7.46)

We now draw the reader’s attention to a special kind of terminology developed in economic theory
to describe the relative local change behaviour of economic functions in qualitative terms. For
x ∈ D(f ), the relative local change behaviour of a function f is called

• inelastic, whenever |εf (x)| < 1,
• unit elastic, when |εf (x)| = 1, and
• elastic, whenever |εf (x)| > 1.

For example, a total cost function K(x) in the diminishing returns picture exhibits unit elastic
behaviour at the minimum efﬁcient scale x = xg2 where, by Eq. (7.22), εK(xg2) = 1. Also, at
the local maximum of an average proﬁt function G(x)/x, the property εG(x) = 1 applies; cf.
Eq. (7.38).

Next, we review the computational rules one needs to adhere to when calculating elasticities for
combinations of two real-valued functions of one real variable in the sense of Sec. 7.1.6:
Computational rules for elasticities
If f and g are differentiable real-valued functions of one real variable, with elasticities εf and εg,
it holds that:

1. product f · g:
2. quotient f

3. concatenation f ◦ g:

εf ·g(x) = εf (x) + εg(x),

(7.47)

To end this chapter, we remark that for a positive differentiable real-valued function f of one
positive real variable x, a second elasticity may be deﬁned according to

εf [εf (x)] := x

d

Of course, by analogy this procedure may be generalised to higher derivatives of f still.

Integral calculus of real-valued functions of
one real variable

In the ﬁnal chapter of these lecture notes we give a brief overview of the main deﬁnitions and
laws of the integral calculus of real-valued functions of one variable. Subsequently we consider
a simple application of this tool in economic theory.

8.1 Indeﬁnite integrals

Def.: Let f be a continuous real-valued function of one real variable and F a differentiable real-
valued function of the same real variable, with D(f ) = D(F ). Given that f and F are related
according to

F ′(x) = f (x)

for all x ∈ D(f ) ,

(8.1)

then F is referred to as a primitive of f.
Remark: The primitive of a given continuous real-valued function f cannot be unique. By the
rules of differentiation discussed in Sec. 7.2, besides F also F + c, with c ∈ R a real-valued
constant, constitutes a primitive of f since (c)′ = 0.
Def.: If F is a primitive of a continuous real-valued function f of one real variable, then

Z f (x) dx = F (x) + c ,

c = constant ∈ R , with F ′(x) = f (x)

(8.2)

deﬁnes the indeﬁnite integral of the function f. The following names are used to refer to the
different ingredients in this expression:
• x — the integration variable,
• f (x) — the integrand,
• dx — the differential, and, lastly,

71

72

CHAPTER8. INTEGRALCALCULUSOFREAL-VALUEDFUNCTIONS

• c — the constant of integration.

For the elementary, continuous real-valued functions of one variable introduced in Sec. 7.1, the
following rules of indeﬁnite integration apply:

Special methods of integration need to be employed when the integrand consists of a concatanation
of elementary real-valued functions. Here we provide a list with the main tools for this purpose.
For differentiable real-valued functions f and g, it holds that

1. R (αf (x) ± βg(x)) dx = αR f (x) dx ± βR g(x) dx
with α, β = constant ∈ R
2. R f (x)g′(x) dx = f (x)g(x) −R f ′(x)g(x) dx

Def.: Let f be a real-valued function of one variable which is continuous on an interval [a, b] ⊂
D(f ), and let F be a primitive of f. Then the expression

x=a = F (b) − F (a)
deﬁnes the deﬁnite integral of f in the limits of integration a and b.
For deﬁnite integrals the following general rules apply:

Remark: The main qualitative difference between an (i) indeﬁnite integral and a (ii) deﬁnite in-
tegral of a continuous real-valued function of one variable reveals intself in the different kinds of
outcome: while (i) yields as a result a real-valued (primitive) function, (ii) simply yields a single
real number.
GDC: For a stored real-valued function, the evaluation of a deﬁnite integral can be performed in

mode CALC with the pre-programmed functionR f(x)dx. The corresponding limits of integration
need to be speciﬁed interactively.
As indicated in Sec. 7.6, the scale-invariant power-law functions f (x) = xα for α ∈ R and
x ∈ R>0 play a special role in practical applications. For x ∈ [a, b] ⊂ R>0 and α 6= −1 it holds
that

8.3 Applications in economic theory

The starting point shall be a simple market situation for a single product. For this product, on the
one-hand side, there be a demand function N(p) (in units) which is monotonously decreasing on
the price interval [pu, po]; the limit values pu and po denote the minimum and maximum prices per
unit (in CU/u) acceptable for the product. On the other hand, the market situation be described by
a supply function A(p) (in units) which is monotonously increasing on [pu, po].
The equilibrium unit price pM (in CU/unit) for this product is deﬁned by assuming a state of
economic equilibrium of the market, quantitatively expressed by the condition

A(pM ) = N(pM ) .

(8.7)

74

CHAPTER8. INTEGRALCALCULUSOFREAL-VALUEDFUNCTIONS

Geometrically, this condition deﬁnes common points of intersection for the functions A(p) and
N(p) (when they exist).
GDC: Common points of intersection for stored functions f and g can be easily determined inter-
actively in mode CALC employing the routine intersect.

In a drastically simpliﬁed fashion, we now turn to compute the revenue made on the market by the
suppliers of a new product for either of three possible strategies of market entry.

1. Strategy 1: The revenue obtained by the suppliers when the new product is being sold

straight at the equilibrium unit price pM , in an amount N(pM ), is simply given by

U1 = U(pM ) = pM N(pM )

(in CU) .

(8.8)

2. Strategy 2: Some consumers would be willing to purchase the product intially also at a unit
price which is higher than pM . If, hence, the suppliers decide to offer the product initially
at a unit price po > pM , and then, in order to generate further demand, to continuously1 (!)
reduce the unit price to the lower pM , the revenue obtained yields the larger value

Since the amount of money

(8.9)

(8.10)

is (theoretically) safed by the consumers when the product is introduced to the market ac-
cording to strategy 1, this amount is referred to in the economic literature as consumer
surplus.

3. Strategy 3: Some suppliers would be willing to introduce the product to the market initially
at a unit price which is lower than pM . If, hence, the suppliers decide to offer the product
initially at a unit price pu < pM , and then to continuously2 (!) raise it to the higher pM , the
revenue obtaines amounts to the smaller value

U3 = U(pM ) −Z pM
