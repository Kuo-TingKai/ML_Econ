Abstract.  In  the  last  years  an  increasing  demand  for  Grid  Infrastructures  has  resulted  in 
several  international  collaborations.  This  is  the  case  of  the  EELA  Project,  which  has 
brought  together  collaborating  groups  of  Latin  America  and  Europe.  One  year  ago  we 
presented this e-infrastructure used, among others, by the Biomedical groups for the studies 
of  oncological  analysis,  neglected  diseases,  sequence  alignments  and  computation 
phylogenetics. After this period, the achieved advances are summarised in this paper. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Funded by the European Commission, the EELA Project (E-Infrastructure shared between 
Europe and Latin America) [1] began in January 2006 to build a digital bridge between the 
existing  e-Infrastructure  initiatives  in  Europe  and  those  that  were  emerging  in  Latin 
America,  throughout  the  creation  of  a  collaborative  network  that  shares  an  interoperable 
Grid infrastructure to support the development and test of advanced applications. 
 
One of the identified areas of work in scientific research is Biomedicine and, consequently,  
the  applications  that  can  be  ported  to  the  Grid.  Some  of  them,  falling  in  the  three  typical 
categories  of  Bioinformatics  Applications,  Computational  Biochemical  Processes  and 
Biomedical  Models,  were  selected  [2]  and  started  to  be  deployed  on  the  pilot  EELA 
infrastructures for both production and dissemination purposes. 
 
This  document  describes  the  achieved  advances  in  these  biomedicine  applications  in  the 
last year. For a more detailed explanation of them, the reader can consult [2] and [3]. 
 
2. GATE 
 
The  C++  platform  based  on  the  Monte  Carlo  GEANT4  software  [4]  GATE  (GEANT4 
Application for Tomographic Emission) [5] models nuclear medicine applications, such as 
PET  and  SPECT  within  the  OpenGATE  collaboration  [6].  The  computational-intensive 
Monte  Carlo  simulations  prevent  hospitals  and  clinical  centres  from  using  them  for  daily 
practice in radiotherapy and brachytherapy treatment planning. As a result, the objective of 
GATE  is  to  use  the  Grid  environment  to  reduce  the  computing  time  of  Monte  Carlo 
simulations providing a higher accuracy in a reasonable period of time 
 

Nine  Cuban  centres  are  currently  testing,  as  users,  the  results  of  the  simulation  of 
radiotherapy treatments using realistic models that GATE provides in two main oncological 
problems: 
  Thyroid Cancer (the diseases of thyroids are one of the 5 main causes of Endocrinology 

treatments) [7]; and, 

  Treatment of metastasis with P32 isotopes [8] by means of the brachytherapy improving 

the knowledge on the doses captured from the different tissues by accurate simulation. 

 
The  EELA  consortium  has  provided  the  support  for  the  installation  and  integration  of  a 
small  Grid  site  in  Cuba  in  order  to  run  the  simplest  jobs  concerning  Monte  Carlo 
simulations. For those cases where the computer load is greater, a previous preparation of 
the  job  is  done  in  Cuba  and,  after  that,  the  necessary  material  is  brought  physically  to 
another EELA sites with a higher bandwidth in order to do the submission process. 
 
Besides  of  that,  some  researchers  have  stayed  as  fellowships  for  a  long  period  at  the 
ITACA–GRyCAP  department  (Valencia,  Spain)  with  the  support  of  the  EELA  funds 
improving their knowledge in Grid and GATE technologies. 
 
As a conclusion, Grid  will  increase the performance to  the application, but  in this case, it 
will even be more important, since it is an enabling technology opening the doors to a new 
range  of  applications  and  possibilities.  All  the  centres  from  Cuba  currently  testing  this 
application bring to the EELA community around 90 cases per month. 
 
3. WISDOM 
 
The objective of WISDOM (Wide in Silico Docking of Malaria) is the proposition of new 
inhibitors  for  a  family  of  proteins  produced  by  Plasmodium  Falciparum  due  to  this 
protozoan parasite  causes malaria  and affects  around 300 million  people and more than 4 
thousand  people  die  daily  in  the  world.  The  cross-resistance  to  antimalarials  produced  by 
the focus on a limited number of biological targets has derived in a drug resistance for all 
classes of antimalarials except artemisinins. Because of this the development of new drugs 
with new targets is necessary, but the process is cost so the economic profit is not clear for 
the drug manufacturers. 
 
This  WISDOM  application  consists  on  the  deployment  of  a  high  throughput  virtual 
screening platform in the perspective of in silico drug discovery for neglected diseases. 
 
The interest of the EELA partners centred in three actions: 
  The study of new targets for new parasitory diseases. 
  The selection of new targets for malaria. 
  The contribution with resources for the WISDOM Data Challenge. 
 
The WISDOM platform [9] has performed in the Fall of 2006 its second High-Throughput 
virtual Docking of million of chemical compounds available in the databases of ligands to 
several targets. In this WISDOM Data Challenge-II [10] ULA has proposed two targets in 
Plasmodium  Vivax  which  have  been  accepted  by  the  consortium  and  docked  within  the 

EELA  as  was  agreed  by  the  WISDOM  DC-II  decision-makers.  This  process  has  been 
coordinated  by  UPV  and  all  the  EELA  sites  have  acted  as  donor  of  computational  and 
storage resources. The results will be presented in future works. 
 
4. BLAST in Grid 
 
The  study  of  the  functionality  of  the  different  genes  and  regions  is  one  of  the  most 
important efforts on the analysis of the genome. If the queries and the alignments are well 
designed  both  functional  and  evolutionary  information  can  be  inferred  from  sequence 
alignments since they provide a powerful way to compare novel sequences with previously 
characterised genes. 
 
The  Basic  Local  Alignment  Search  Tool  (BLAST)  [11]  finds  regions  of  local  similarity 
between  sequences.  The  program  compares  nucleotide  or  protein  sequences  to  databases 
and  calculates  the  statistical  significance  of  matches.  This  process  of  finding  homologous 
of  sequences  is  very  computationally-intensive  since  the  searching  alignment  of  a  single 
sequence is not a costly task, but normally, thousands of sequences are searched at the same 
time. 
 
The biocomputing community usually relies on either local installations or public servers, 
such as the NCBI [12] or the gPS@ [13], but the limitations on the number of simultaneous 
queries make this environment inefficient for large tests. Moreover, since the databases are 
periodically  updated,  it  will  be  convenient  to  do  the  same  with  the  results  of  previous 
studies. 
 
BLAST  has  been  ported  to  the  Grid  according  to  different  approaches  [14]  because  the 
number of fragments to be analysed and the periodical updating of the information will be 
increased.  EELA  has  adopted  the  availability  of  an  independent  Grid-enabled  version 
integrated  on  the  Bioinformatics  Portal  of  the  Universidad  de  los  Andes  [15]  providing 
registered users with results in a shorter time. Basically the users access the service through 
this web portal and, after that, to the EELA Grid with a Gate-to-Grid, i. e., an EELA Grid 
node which provides a WSRF-Based web interface. The security is provided by means of a 
MyProxy server which generates manually and temporally certificates that will be retrieved 
by the UI when required. 
 
BLAST  in  Grid  (BiG)  has  been  used  for  searching  similar  sequences  and  inferring  their 
function  in  parasite  diseases  such  as  the  Leishmaniasis  (mainly  Mexican  Leishmania), 
Chagas (mainly Trypanosoma Cruzi) and Malaria (mainly Plasmodium vivax). 
 
5. Phylogeny (MrBayes) 
 
A phylogeny is  a reconstruction of the evolutionary history of  a  group of organisms  used 
throughout the life sciences, as it offers a structure around which to organize the knowledge 
and data accumulated by researchers. Computational phylogenetics has been a rich area for 
algorithm design over the last 15  years. The inference of phylogenies with  computational 
methods  is  widely  used  in  medical  and  biological  research  and  has  many  important 

applications,  such  as  gene  function  prediction,  drug  discovery  and  conservation  biology 
[16]. 
 
The  most  commonly  used  methods  to  infer  phylogenies  include  cladistics,  phenetics, 
maximum likelihood, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based Bayesian inference. 
These  last  two  depend  upon  a  mathematical  model  describing  the  evolution  of  characters 
observed in the included species, and are usually used for molecular phylogeny where the 
characters are aligned nucleotide or amino acid sequences. 
 
Due to the nature of Bayesian inference, the simulation can be prone to entrapment in local 
optima.  To  overcome  local  optima  and  achieve  better  estimation,  the  MrBayes  program 
[17]  has  to  run  for  millions  of  iterations  (generations)  which  require  a  large  amount  of 
computation time. For multiple sessions with different models or parameters, it will take a 
very long time before the results can be analyzed and summarized. 
 
The  phylogenetic  tools  are  widely  demanded  by  the  Latin  America  bioinformatics 
community.  A Grid service for the parallelised version of MrBayes application is currently 
being  developed  and  a  simple  interface  will  be  deployed  on  the  bioinformatics  portal  of 
Universidad de los  Andes [18] in  a similar way to that done for  BiG. Nevertheless, some 
previous works with this parallelization have been successfully submitted and executed in 
the EELA infrastructure and been demonstrated in the first EELA conference [19]. 
 
6. Conclusion and new challenges 
 
The EELA e-infrastructure  is  permitting various  collaborative  groups in  Latin America  to 
use  more  powerful  computational  resources  than  those  available  on  their  centers.  This 
achieves  that  the  lines  of  investigation  stated  in  the  document  can  be  feasible  as  the 
computational requirements for them are being met and new results are being offered to the 
scientific community. 
 
The  EELA  project  currently  has  four  biomedical  pilot  applications  running,  but  is  also 
looking for new ones. For this purpose, it is  offering its support with  initiatives like Grid 
School [20]. As a result, new biomedical applications such as EMBOSS [21] will be ported 
to  the  Grid  very  soon.  With  this  free  Open  Source  software  analysis  package  specially 
developed  for  the  needs  of  the  molecular  biology  user  community  EELA  will  keep  on 
working in the Biomedical field.
