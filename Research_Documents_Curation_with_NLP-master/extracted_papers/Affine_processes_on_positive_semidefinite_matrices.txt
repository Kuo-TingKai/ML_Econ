This article provides the mathematical foundation for stochasti-
cally continuous aﬃne processes on the cone of positive semideﬁnite
symmetric matrices. This analysis has been motivated by a large and
growing use of matrix-valued aﬃne processes in ﬁnance, including
multi-asset option pricing with stochastic volatility and correlation
structures, and ﬁxed-income models with stochastically correlated
risk factors and default intensities.

structures, and ﬁxed-income models with stochastically correlated risk fac-
tors and default intensities.

For illustration, let us consider a multi-variate stochastic volatility model
consisting of a d-dimensional logarithmic price process with risk-neutral dy-
namics

(1.1)

dYt = (r1 − 1

2 X diag

t

) dt +pXt dBt,

Y0 = y,

and stochastic covariation process X = hY, Y i, which is a proxy for the in-
stantaneous covariance of the price returns. Here B denotes a standard d-
dimensional Brownian motion, r the constant interest rate, 1 the vector
whose entries are all equal to one and X diag the vector containing the diag-
onal entries of X.

The necessity to specify X as a process in S+

d such that it qualiﬁes as
covariation process is one of the mathematically interesting and demanding
aspects of such models. Beyond that, the modeling of X must allow for
enough ﬂexibility in order to reﬂect the stylized facts of ﬁnancial data and
to adequately capture the dependence structure of the diﬀerent assets. If
these requirements are met, the model can be used as a basis for ﬁnancial
decision-making in the area of portfolio optimization, pricing of multi-asset
options and hedging of correlation risk.

The tractability of such a model crucially depends on the dynamics of X.
A large part of the literature in the area of multivariate stochastic volatility
modeling has proposed the following aﬃne dynamics for X:

(1.2)

dXt = (b + HXt + XtH⊤) dt +pXt dWt Σ + Σ⊤ dW ⊤t pXt + dJt,
X0 = x ∈ S+
d ,

where b is some suitably chosen matrix in S+
d , H, Σ some invertible matrices,
W a standard d × d-matrix of Brownian motions possibly correlated with
B, and J a pure jump process whose compensator is an aﬃne function of
X.3

The main reason for the analytic tractability of this model is that, under

some technical conditions, the following aﬃne transform formula holds:

Ex,y[e− Tr(zXt)+v⊤Yt] = eΦ(t,z,v)+Tr(Ψ(t,z,v)x)+v⊤ y

for appropriate arguments z ∈ Sd × iSd and v ∈ Cd. The functions Φ and Ψ
solve a system of nonlinear ordinary diﬀerential equations (ODEs), which

3This aﬃne multi-variate stochastic volatility model generalizes the well-known one-
dimensional models of Heston [27], for the diﬀusion case, or the Barndorﬀ-Nielsen Shepard
model [2], for the pure jump case.

are determined by the model parameters. Setting v = 0, φ(t, z) = −Φ(t, z, 0)
and ψ(t, z) = −Ψ(t, z, 0) and taking z = u ∈ S+
Ex[e− Tr(uXt)] = e−φ(t,u)−Tr(ψ(t,u)x),
(1.3)

d , we arrive at
u ∈ S+
d .

In this paper, we characterize the class of all stochastically continuous
time-homogeneous Markov processes with the key property (1.3)—henceforth
called aﬃne processes—on S+
d . Our main result shows that an aﬃne pro-
cess is necessarily a Feller process whose generator has aﬃne coeﬃcients
in the state variables. The parameters of the generator satisfy some well-
determined admissibility conditions, and are in a one-to-one relation with
those of the corresponding ODEs for φ and ψ. Conversely, and more impor-
tantly for applications, we show that for any admissible parameter set there
exists a unique well-behaved aﬃne process on S+
d . Furthermore, we prove
that any stochastically continuous inﬁnitely decomposable Markov process
on S+

d is aﬃne with zero diﬀusion, and vice versa.

On the one hand, our ﬁndings extend the model class (1.2), since a
more general drift and jumps are possible. Indeed, we allow for full gen-
erality in b, as long as b − (d − 1)ΣT Σ ∈ S+
d , for a general linear drift part
B(x) =Pij xijβij and for an inclusion of (inﬁnite activity) jumps. This of
course enables more ﬂexibility in ﬁnancial modeling. For example, due to
the general linear drift part, the volatility of one asset can generally de-
pend on the other ones, which is not possible for B(x) = Hx + xH⊤. On
the other hand, we now know the exact assumptions under which aﬃne pro-
d actually exist. Our characterization of aﬃne processes on S+
cesses on S+
d
is thus exhaustive. Beyond that, the equivalence of inﬁnitely decomposable
Markov processes with state space S+
d and aﬃne processes without diﬀusion
is interesting in its own right.

This paper complements Duﬃe, Filipovi´c and Schachermayer [16], who
analyzed time-homogeneous aﬃne processes on the state space Rm
+ × Rn.4
Matrix-valued aﬃne processes seem to have been studied systematically for
the ﬁrst time in the literature by Bru [5, 6], who introduced the so called
Wishart processes. These are generalizations of squares of matrix Ornstein–
Uhlenbeck processes, that is, of the form (1.2) for J = 0 and b = kΣ⊤Σ, for
some real parameter k > d− 1. Note that k > d− 1 is a stronger assumption
than what we require on b and Σ⊤Σ. Bru [6] then establishes existence
and uniqueness of a local5 S+
d -valued solution to (1.2) under the additional
assumptions that X0 has distinct eigenvalues, −H ∈ S+
d , and that H and Σ
commute (see [6], Theorem 2′′). In the more special case where H = 0 and

k > d− 1, Bru [6] shows global existence and uniqueness for (1.2) for any X0
with distinct eigenvalues (see [6], Theorem 2 and last part of Section 3).6
Bru’s results concerning strong solutions have recently been extended to the
case of matrix valued jump-diﬀusions; see [40].

Wishart processes have subsequently been introduced in the ﬁnancial lit-
erature by Gourieroux and Sufana [24, 25] and Gourieroux et al. [23]. Fi-
nancial applications thereof have then been taken up and carried further by
various authors, including Da Fonseca et al. [9–12] and Buraschi, Cieslak
and Trojani [7, 8]. Grasselli and Tebaldi [26] give some general results on
the solvability of the corresponding Riccati ODEs. Barndorﬀ-Nielsen and
Stelzer [3] provide a theory for a certain class of matrix-valued L´evy driven
Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes of ﬁnite variation. Leippold and Trojani [38]
introduce S+
d -valued aﬃne jump diﬀusions and provide ﬁnancial examples,
including multi-variate option pricing, ﬁxed-income models and dynamic
portfolio choice. All of these models are contained in our framework.

We want to point out that the full characterization of positive semideﬁ-
nite matrix-valued aﬃne processes needs a multitude of methods. In order
to prove the fundamental property of regularity of aﬃne processes another
adaption of the famous analysis of Montgommery and Zippin is necessary,
+ × Rn. For
which has been worked out in [34] and [35] for the state space Rm
the necessary conditions on drift, diﬀusion and jump parameters we need
the theory of inﬁnitely divisible distributions on S+
d . Most interestingly, the
constant drift part b must satisfy a condition depending on the magnitude
of the diﬀusion component (see Proposition 4.18), which is in accordance
with the choice of the drift in Bru’s work [6] on Wishart processes, as ex-
plained above. This enigmatic additional condition on the drift b is derived
by studying the process with respect to well chosen test functions, including
in our case the determinant of the process. It is worth noting, as already
visible in dimension one, that a naive application of classical geometric in-
variance conditions does not bring the correct necessary result on the drift
but a stronger one. Indeed, take a one-dimensional aﬃne diﬀusion process
X solving

dXt = b dt +pXt dWt.

Then a back-of-the-envelope calculation would yield the Stratonovich drift at
the boundary point x = 0 of value b− 1
4 , leading to the necessary parameter
restriction b ≥ 1
4 , which is indeed too strong. It is well known that the correct
parameter restriction is b ≥ 0. We see two reasons why geometric conditions

6Actually, Bru [6] establishes existence and uniqueness of solutions also for k =
1, . . . , d − 1. But these are degenerate solutions, as they are only deﬁned on lower-
dimensional subsets of the boundary of S+

d (see [6], Corollary 1).

on the drift cannot be applied: ﬁrst, precisely at the boundary of our state
spaces the diﬀusion coeﬃcients are not Lipschitz continuous anymore, and,
second, the boundary of the cone of positive semi-deﬁnite matrices is not a
smooth submanifold but a more complicated object.

For the suﬃcient direction reﬁned methods from stochastic invariance the-
ory are applied. Having established viability of a particular class of jump-
diﬀusions on S+
d —under the necessary
parameter conditions—is shown through the solution of a martingale prob-
lem. Uniqueness follows by semigroup methods which need the theory of
multi-dimensional Riccati equations.

d , existence of aﬃne processes on S+

Summing up, we face two major problems in the analysis of positive ma-
trix valued aﬃne processes. First, the candidate stochastic diﬀerential equa-
tions necessarily lead to volatility terms which are not Lipschitz continuous
at the boundary of the state space. This makes every existence, uniqueness
and invariance question delicate. Second, the jump behavior transversal to
the boundary is of ﬁnite total variation.

1.1. Program of the article. For aﬃne processes on S+

d , results and proofs
deviate in essential points from the theory on state spaces of the form Rm
+ ×
Rn given in [16, 34], which is a consequence of the more involved geometry
of this nonpolyhedral cone. The program of the paper as outlined below
therefore includes a comparison with the approach in [16].

Section 2 contains the main deﬁnition and a summary of the results of
this article. In Section 3, we then derive two main properties, namely the
regularity of the process and the Feller property of the associated semigroup.
The Feller property, in turn, is a simple consequence of an important posi-
tivity result of the characteristic exponents φ, ψ, which is proved in Lemma
3.3. This lemma is further employed as a tool for the treatment of the gener-
alized Riccati diﬀerential equations in Section 5.1 (see proof of Proposition
5.3). The global existence and uniqueness of these equations is then used to
show uniqueness of the martingale problem for aﬃne processes (see proof of
Proposition 5.9).

In Section 4, we deﬁne a set of admissible parameters specifying the in-
ﬁnitesimal generator of aﬃne semigroups and prove the necessity of the
parameter restrictions (see Proposition 4.9).

The suﬃcient direction is then treated in Section 5. It is known that, for
d ≥ 2, there exist continuous aﬃne processes on S+
d which are—in contrast
+ × Rn—not inﬁnitely divisible (see Example
to those on the state space Rm
2.8). The analysis of this paper reveals the failure of inﬁnite divisibility as
a consequence of the drift condition (see proof of Theorem 2.9). This has
substantial inﬂuence on the approach chosen here to prove existence of aﬃne
processes associated with a given parameter set: Being in general hindered
to recognize the solutions of the generalized Riccati diﬀerential equations as

6

cumulant generating functions of sub-stochastic measures, as done in [16],
Section 7, we solve the martingale problem for the associated L´evy type
generator on S+
d , as exposed in Section 5 and Appendix A. In Section 5.3,
however, we deliver a variant of the existence proof of [16] for pure jump
processes, which is possible in this case due to the absence of a diﬀusion
component.

Finally, Section 6 contains the proofs of the main results which build on

the propositions of the previous sections.

1.2. Notation. For the stochastic background and notation, we refer to
standard text books such as [31] and [43]. We write R+ = [0,∞) and R++ =
(0,∞). Moreover:
• Sd denotes the space of symmetric d× d-matrices equipped with the scalar
product hx, yi = Tr(xy). Note that Sd is isomorphic, but not isometric, to
the standard Euclidean space Rd(d+1)/2. We denote by {cij, i ≤ j} the
standard basis of Sd, that is, the (kl)th component of cij is given by cij
kl =
δikδjl + δjkδil(1− δij), where δij denotes the Kronecker delta. Additionally,
we sometimes consider the following basis elements {eij , i ≤ j} which are
positive semideﬁnite and form a basis of Sd:

eij =(cid:26) cii,

cii + cij + cjj,

if i = j,
if i 6= j.

• Id denotes the d × d-identity matrix.
Throughout this paper, a function f : Sd → R is understood as the restriction
f = g|Sd of a function g : Md → R which satisﬁes g(x) = g(x⊤) for all x ∈ Md.
Without loss of generality g(x) = f ((x + x⊤)/2). We avoid using the vech
operator, that is, to identify x ∈ Sd with a vector in Rd(d+1)/2 by stringing
the columns of x together, while only taking the entries xij with i ≤ j.
Throughout this article, we shall consider the following function spaces
for measurable U ⊆ Sd. We write B(U ) for the Borel σ-algebra on U . bU

functions f on U with norm kfk∞ = supx∈U |f (x)|. We write C(U ) for the
space of real-valued continuous functions f on U , Cb(U ) for C(U ) ∩ bU ,
Cc(U ) for the space of functions f ∈ C(U ) with compact support and C0(U )
for the Banach space of functions f ∈ C(U ) with limx→∆ f (x) = 0 and norm
kfk∞ = supx∈U|f (x)|. Furthermore, C k(U ) is the space of k times diﬀeren-
tiable functions f on U◦, the interior of U , such that all partial derivatives of
f up to order k belong to C(U ). As usual, we set C∞(U ) =Tk≥1 C k(U ), and
b (U ) = Cb(U ) ∩ C k(U ), for k ≤ ∞.
2. Deﬁnition and characterization of aﬃne processes. We consider a

we write C k

We note that X may not be conservative. Then there is a standard extension
of the transition probabilities to the one-point compactiﬁcation S+

of S+

d by deﬁning

pt(x,{∆}) = 1 − pt(x, S+
d ),

pt(∆,{∆}) = 1

for all t and x ∈ S+

d , with the convention that f (∆) = 0 for any function f

(i) it is stochastically continuous, that is, lims→t ps(x,·) = pt(x,·) weakly

Note that stochastic continuity of X implies that φ(t, u) and ψ(t, u) are
jointly continuous in (t, u); see Lemma 3.2(iii) below. Moreover, due to the
Markov property, this also means that pt(x,{∆}) < 1 for all x ∈ S+
d and
t ≥ 0. In contrast to [16], we take stochastic continuity as part of the deﬁ-
nition of aﬃne processes, and consider the Laplace transform instead of the
characteristic function. The latter is justiﬁed by the nonnegativity of X, the
former is by convenience since, as we will see in Proposition 3.4 below, it
automatically implies regularity in the following sense.

We remark that there are simple examples of Markov processes which
satisfy Deﬁnition 2.1(ii) but are not stochastically continuous; see [16], Re-
mark 2.11. However, such processes are of limited interest for applications
and will not be considered.

In the following, we shall provide an equivalent characterization of the
aﬃne property in terms of the generator of X. As we shall see in (2.12), the
diﬀusion, drift, jump and killing characteristics of X depend in an aﬃne way
on the underlying state. We denote by χ : Sd → Sd some bounded continuous
truncation function with χ(ξ) = ξ in a neighborhood of 0. Then the involved
parameters are admissible in the following sense.

We shall comment more on the admissibility conditions in Section 2.1
below. The following three theorems contain the main results of this article.
Their proofs are given in Section 6. First, we provide a characterization of
aﬃne processes on S+
d in terms of the admissible parameter set introduced in
Deﬁnition 2.3. As for the domain of the generator, we consider the space S+
of rapidly decreasing C∞-functions on S+
d , deﬁned in (B.1) below. It is shown
in Appendix B that e−hu,·i ∈ S+, for u ∈ S++

In [16] it was shown that regular aﬃne processes on Rm

+ × Rn are inﬁnitely
decomposable Markov processes, and vice versa. In fact, this property was
the core for the existence proof of aﬃne processes in [16]. On S+
d the situation
is diﬀerent. The following counterexample reveals that not all aﬃne processes
on S+

d are inﬁnitely divisible.

Example 2.8. The aﬃne process X on S+

d corresponding to the param-
eter set (α = Id, b = δId, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), where δ ∈ [d− 1,∞), is the diﬀusion pro-
cess initially studied by Bru [6]. By [6], Theorem 3, the Laplace-transforms

Ex[e−hXt,ui] = (det(I + 2tu))−δ/2e−h(I+2tu)−1u,xi

are those of noncentral Wishart distributions WIS(δ, d, x). By a well-known
result due to Paul L´evy, these Wishart distributions are not inﬁnitely divis-
ible if d ≥ 2 (see [15], Section 2.C).

2.1.1. Diﬀusion. The diﬀusion term does not admit a constant part, and

its linear part is of the very speciﬁc form

hu, A(x)ui = 4hx, uαui.

This property of A(x) has also been stated in the setting of symmetric cones
in [26]. We could thus write the second order diﬀerential operator in (2.12)
as

1

2 Xi,j,k,l

Aijkl(x)

∂2f (x)
∂xij ∂xkl

= 2hx,∇α∇f (x)i.

The reason why we introduce and use the symmetrization (2.13) of A(x) is
that it corresponds to the quadratic characteristic (2.19) of the semimartin-
gale X.

2.1.2. Drift. The remarkable drift condition (2.4) has been assumed in
many previous papers. Here is the ﬁrst time where necessity and suﬃciency
of (2.4) are proved in the full generality in the presence of jumps. Note
that in dimension d = 1, the drift condition simply reduces to nonnegativity
b ≥ 0. But for dimension d ≥ 2, the boundary of the state space S+
d becomes
curved and kinked, implying a nontrivial trade-oﬀ between diﬀusion α and
b.

(2.27)

B⊤ij (u) = hβij, ui,

since hB(x), ui = hPi,j βijxij, ui =Pi,jhβij, uixij = hB⊤(u), xi.

In most previous papers, B(x) is of the form

(2.28)

In this case,

B(x) = Hx + xH⊤.

hB(x), ui = hHx + xH⊤, ui = 0

usual form (2.28): let d = 2 and

B(x) =(cid:18) x22 x12
x12 x11(cid:19) .

It can be easily checked that (2.11) is satisﬁed, while B(x) cannot be brought
into the form (2.28). If xii models the (squared) volatility of the ith stock
price, as in (1.1), then this drift speciﬁcation admits level impacts of the
volatility of stock 1 on the volatility of stock 2, and vice versa.

2.1.4. Jumps. Condition (2.7) means that jumps described by m, which
can for instance appear at x = 0, should be of ﬁnite variation entering the
cone S+
d , since inﬁnite variation transversal to the boundary would let the
process leave the state space. Similarly, condition (2.9) asserts ﬁnite variation
for the inward pointing directions, while we could a priori have a general
jump behavior (supported by S+
d due to the aﬃne structure) parallel to
the boundary. Note that in the case d = 1, which corresponds to R+, the
linear jump part can have inﬁnite total variation (see [16], equation (2.11)).
However, due to the geometry of the cone S+
d , we conjecture that in higher
dimensions d ≥ 2 such a behavior is no longer possible and that all jumps are
in fact of ﬁnite total variation. In any case, for d ≥ 2, aﬃne positive matrix
valued diﬀusion processes cannot be approximated (in law) by pure jump
processes, since this would yield a contradiction to condition (2.4). See also
Remark 5.12 below.

3. Aﬃne processes are regular and Feller. Suppose X is an aﬃne process
on S+
d . The main result of this section is that X is regular in the sense of
Deﬁnition 2.1. In addition, we shall prove that Pt is a Feller semigroup on
C0(S+
d ). In order to show both properties, we shall mainly rely on Lemma 3.3
below. The Feller property is then a simple consequence of this statement
and regularity is obtained by arguing as in Keller-Ressel, Schachermayer
and Teichmann [35], who obtained the corresponding statements for aﬃne
processes on the state space Rm
+ × Rn; see [35], Theorem 4.3, and also the
Ph.D. thesis of Keller-Ressel [34]. We observe that most arguments of [35]
translate to our setting without major changes. It is only required to tailor
some technicalities to the cone S+
d . We start with the following elementary
observations.

Lemma 3.1.

Proof. Let x ∈ S+

0 ≤ hv, xi ≤ hu, xi = 0. Hence, v ∈ ∂S+

We now derive some ﬁrst properties of the functions φ and ψ in (2.1).

Lemma 3.2. Let X be an aﬃne process on S+

d . Then, we have:

(i) The functions φ and ψ satisfy

(3.1)

(3.2)

φ(t + s, u) = φ(t, u) + φ(s, ψ(t, u)),

ψ(t + s, u) = ψ(s, ψ(t, u))

for all t, s ∈ R+.

For the proof of (ii), note that v (cid:22) u is equivalent to hv, xi ≤ hu, xi for all
x ∈ S+
d . By the monotonicity of the exponential function, we have for all
x ∈ S+
d and for all t ≥ 0,

e−φ(t,v)−hψ(t,v),xi =ZS+

d

e−hv,ξipt(x, dξ) ≥ZS+

d

and the assertion follows by taking logarithms.

Concerning statement (iii), note that stochastic continuity of X implies
joint continuity of Pte−hu,xi in (t, u) ∈ R+ × S+
d (this follows, e.g., from [4],
Lemma 23.7), for all x ∈ S+
d . This in turn yields continuity of the func-
tions (t, u) 7→ φ(t, u) and (t, u) 7→ ψ(t, u). The second assertion follows from
analyticity properties of the Laplace transform. (cid:3)

The following property of ψ is crucial.

Lemma 3.3. Let ψ : R+ × S+

d be any map satisfying ψ(0, u) = u
and the properties (i)–(iii) of Lemma 3.2 (regarding the function ψ). Then
ψ(t, u) ∈ S++

d → S+
for all (t, u) ∈ R+ × S++
.

Proof. We adapt the proof of [34], Proposition 1.10, to our setting.
Assume by contradiction that there exists some (t, u) ∈ R+ × S++
such that
ψ(t, u) ∈ ∂S+
d . Let us consider the interval (0, λmin(u)] 6= ∅, where λmin(u) >
0 denotes the smallest eigenvalue of u. Then for all v ∈ (0, λmin(u)] we have
vId (cid:22) u. Since ψ(t, u) admits property (ii) of Lemma 3.2, we obtain

the set of zeros of det(ψ(t, vId)) has an accumulation point in R++, which
implies that det(ψ(t, vId)) vanishes entirely on R++. The same statement
holds true for t replaced by t
d , then the assertion
is shown by the same arguments as above. Otherwise, if ψ( t

det(cid:18)ψ(cid:18) t

a contradiction, and the assertion is proved. (cid:3)

We may now formulate the main result of this section.

Proposition 3.4. Let X be an aﬃne process with state space S+

d . Then,

we have:

(i) X is a Feller process.
(ii) X is regular.

Proof.

In order to prove (i), it suﬃces to show that for all f ∈ C0(S+

e.g., [48]), the linear span of the set {e−hu,xi | u ∈ S++

Indeed, it is a subalgebra of C0(S+
d ), separates points and vanishes nowhere,
as all elements are strictly positive functions on S+
d . From Lemma 3.3, we

can deduce that Pte−hu,xi ∈ C0(S+

Pte−hu,xi = e−φ(t,u)−hψ(t,u),xi

goes to 0 as x → ∆. Hence, statement (i) is proved.
The proof of (ii) follows precisely the lines of [35], proof of Theorem
4.3. Using Lemma 3.3, one may mimic the proof of [35], Theorem 4.3, to
obtain that diﬀerentiability of ψ(t, u) in u ∈ S++
, which follows from Lemma
3.2(iii), implies diﬀerentiability of ψ(t, u) in t for t = 0 and for all u ∈ S+
d .

d

(cid:3)

By the regularity of X, we are now allowed to diﬀerentiate the equations
(3.1) and (3.2) with respect to t and evaluate them at t = 0. As a conse-
quence, φ and ψ satisfy the system of diﬀerential equations

where F and R are deﬁned as in (2.2). The analysis of these (generalized
Riccati) diﬀerential equations is subject of Section 5.1, whereas the speciﬁc
form of F and R is elaborated in the following.

4. Necessary parameter restrictions.

In this section, we derive necessary
parametric restrictions, that is, given an aﬃne process on S+
d , we determine
necessary implications on a set of parameters which only ensue from Deﬁ-
nition 2.1. These conditions are precisely the conditions on the admissible
parameter set as of Deﬁnition 2.3. The form of the functions F and R as
deﬁned by (2.2) is then characterized by means of this parameter set, which
is stated in Proposition 4.9 below. For its proof, we ﬁrst provide a number
of technical prerequisites.

Lemma 4.1. Let x, u ∈ S+

d and

x = OΛO⊤ = O diag(λ1 > 0, . . . , λd−r > 0, 0, . . . , 0)O⊤

(4.1)
be the diagonalization of x with r ≥ 0 and O ∈ O(d). Then the following
assertions are equivalent:

(i) ux = xu = 0,
(ii) hx, ui = 0,
(iii) u is of form

(4.2)

with w ∈ S+
r .

u = O(cid:18) 0

0 w(cid:19) O⊤

0

Proof. The direction (i) ⇒ (ii) is obvious. In order to prove the impli-

cation (ii) ⇒ (iii), deﬁne v as v = O⊤uO. Then we have
λivii,

0 = hx, ui = hΛ, O⊤uOi = Xi≤d−r

which implies vii = 0 for all i ≤ d − r and by the positive deﬁniteness of v it
must then be of form

v =(cid:18) 0

0 w(cid:19)

0

with w ∈ S+
which proves the direction (iii) ⇒ (i). (cid:3)

r . Thus, u is given by (4.2). This then implies that ux = xu = 0,

Lemma 4.2. Let p be an orthogonal projector, that is, p ∈ S+
d and p2 = p
(see, e.g., Kato [33], Section I.6.7), and deﬁne q = Id − p. Then q is an
orthogonal projector and the orthogonal complement of p in S+

d equals

{v ∈ S+

d | hp, vi = 0} = {quq | u ∈ S+
d }.

Proof. That q is an orthogonal projector follows by inspection. The
diagonalization of p is of the form p = OΛO⊤ with Λ = diag(1, . . . , 1, 0, . . . , 0),
and thus q = O(Id − Λ)O⊤. In view of Lemma 4.1, we conclude that v ∈ S+
is orthogonal to p if and only if v = qvq. This proves the assertion. (cid:3)

Lemma 4.3. Let u be in Sd and x ∈ ∂S+

the linear map Tu deﬁned by

d such that ux = xu = 0. Then,

d − R+x) ⊆ S+
d .

(i) Tu is self-adjoint and Tu(S+
(ii) There exists an element v ∈ Sd such that Tuv = u.
Proof. The assertion (i) is obvious, since for every k ∈ R+, Tukx =
kuxu = 0 and Tuv = uvu ∈ S+
d . For proving part (ii), we use the
fact that x is of form (4.1) and that all zero divisors u in Sd of x can be
represented by (4.2) with w ∈ Sr. Thus, setting

d if v ∈ S+
v = O(cid:18) 0

0 w+(cid:19) O⊤,

where w+ satisﬁes ww+w = w, yields Tuv = u. (cid:3)

Lemma 4.4. Let V denote a vector space8 over R. Let L : S+

an additive (resp., homogeneous additive) map, that is, for all x, y ∈ S+
λ = 1 (resp., for all λ ∈ R+) we have

d → V be
d and

L(x + λy) = L(x) + λL(y).

Then L(x) is the restriction of an additive (resp., R-linear) map on Sd.

x, y ∈ S+

Since S+

d such that u − v = x − y we have

holds, as for λ > 0, z = x − y ∈ Sd we have by deﬁnition

Proof. We deﬁne the map eL : Sd → V as
eL(x − y) := L(x) − L(y),
eL is well deﬁned, as for u, v, x, y ∈ S+
L(u) − L(v) =eL(u − v) =eL(x − y) = L(x) − L(y).
d = Sd, the domain of eL is all of Sd. Also, L(0) = 0 by the
d . Homogeneity of eL
additivity of L. Hence, L is the restriction of eL to S+
eL(λz) = L(λx) − L(λy) = λL(x) − λL(y) = λeL(z).
Finally, we show additivity of eL. Choose w, z ∈ Sd such that z = x − y, w =
u − v, hence w + z = (x + u) − (y + v). By the deﬁnition of eL, we have
eL(w) = L(u) − L(v),

and by the additivity of L we obtain

maps Sd → Sd, or the vector space of ﬁnite signed measures on Sd.

We now provide a convergence result for Laplace transforms (in fact
Laplace–Fourier transforms), which is most relevant for the analysis of aﬃne
processes.

Lemma 4.5. Let νn be a sequence of measures on Sd with

Ln(u) =ZSd

e−hu,ξiνn(dξ) < ∞ and

Ln(u) = L(u),

lim
n→∞

u ∈ S+
d ,

pointwise, for some ﬁnite function L on S+
d continuous at u = 0. Then νn
converges weakly to some ﬁnite measure ν on Sd and the Fourier–Laplace
transforms converge for u ∈ S++
d ∪ {0} and v ∈ Sd to the Fourier–Laplace
transforms of ν, that is,

In particular, ν(Sd) = limn→∞ νn(Sd) and

n→∞ZSd

e−hu+iv,ξiνn(dξ) =ZSd
L(u) =ZSd

e−hu,ξiν(dξ),

e−hu+iv,ξiν(dξ).

for all u ∈ S++

d ∪ {0}.

Remark 4.6.

Instead of u = 0 we could take any set K of points at the
boundary K ⊂ ∂S+
d : if we assume continuity of L at points in K, then we
obtain the equality of L with the Laplace transform of ν for all points in
K. Additionally, continuity is too strong an assumption, since we only need
right continuity of L along the segment u + εId for ε = 0 at the points from
the boundary under consideration.

Proof of Lemma 4.5. Since νn(Sd) = Ln(0) is bounded, we know by
general theory that νn has a vague accumulation point ν, which is a ﬁnite
measure on Sd.

Since Ln(u) < ∞ on S+

d , it follows by well-known regularity properties of
Laplace transforms (see, e.g., [19], Lemma 10.8) that the functions Ln admit
an analytic extension on the strip S++

d + iSd, still denoted by Ln:

(u + iv) 7→ Ln(u + iv) =ZSd

e−hu+iv,ξiνn(dξ).

Moreover, pointwise convergence of the ﬁnite convex functions Ln to L on S+
d
implies that this convergence is in fact uniform on compact subsets of S++
(see, e.g., Rockafellar [44], Theorem 10.8). Hence, the functions Ln are uni-
formly bounded on compact subsets of S++
and since |Ln(u + iv)| ≤ Ln(u),
also on compact subsets of S++
is a set

d + iSd. Therefore, and since S++

of uniqueness in S++
d + iSd, it follows by Vitali’s theorem ([41], Chapter 1,
Proposition 7) that the analytic functions Ln converge uniformly on com-
pact subsets of S++
d + iSd to an analytic limit thereon. By L´evy’s continu-
ity theorem, we therefore know that for any u ∈ S++
the ﬁnite measures
exp(−hu, ξi)νn(dξ) converge weakly to a limit, which by uniqueness of the
weak limit has to equal exp(−hu, ξi)ν(dξ). Whence the only vague accumu-
lation point of νn is ν. Vague convergence implies weak convergence if mass
is conserved. Continuity of L(u) at u = 0 implies this mass conservation:
indeed, by weak convergence of e−hεId,ξiνn we arrive at

d

L(εId) = lim

e−hεId,ξiνn(dξ) =ZSd
n→∞ZSd
e−hεId,ξi1{hId,ξi≤0}ν(dξ) +ZSd
=ZSd

e−hεId,ξiν(dξ)

e−hεId,ξi1{hId,ξi>0}ν(dξ)

and therefore—by dominated convergence—we obtain that the limit ε → 0
yields

L(0) =ZSd

ν(dξ),

which is the desired mass conservation, hence weak convergence, which
means in turn convergence of the Fourier–Laplace transform at u = 0. (cid:3)

Finally, let us state a general comparison result for ODEs and hereto
introduce the notion of quasi-monotonicity, which we shall need several times
throughout this article, in particular in the proofs of Propositions 4.9 and
5.3 below.

Definition 4.7. Let U ⊂ Sd be an open set. A function f : U → Sd is
d which

called quasi-monotone increasing if for all elements x, y ∈ U , u ∈ S+
satisfy x (cid:22) y and hx, ui = hy, ui,

holds true. Accordingly, we call f quasi-constant if both f and −f are quasi-
monotone increasing.

hf (x), ui ≤ hf (y), ui

The following comparison result can be deduced from a more general

theorem proved by Volkmann [52].

Theorem 4.8. Let U ⊂ Sd be an open set. Let f : [0, T ) × U → Sd be a
continuous locally Lipschitz map such that f (t,·) is quasi-monotone increas-
ing on U for all t ∈ [0, T ). Let 0 < t0 ≤ T and x, y : [0, t0) → U be diﬀeren-
tiable maps such that x(0) (cid:22) y(0) and

˙x(t) − f (t, x(t)) (cid:22) ˙y(t) − f (t, y(t)),

0 ≤ t < t0.

Then we have x(t) (cid:22) y(t) for all t ∈ [0, t0).

4.1. The functions F and R. The main result of this section characterizes

the form of the functions F and R as deﬁned by (2.2).

Proposition 4.9. Let X be an aﬃne process with state space S+

d . Then
there exist parameters (α, b, βij, c, γ, m, µ), where α, βij, c, γ, m, µ satisfy the
admissibility conditions of Deﬁnition 2.3 and b ∈ S+
d , such that the functions
F and R are of the form (2.16) and (2.17).

Remark 4.10. Note that for the moment we only obtain b ∈ S+

d , and

not (2.4).

Proof of Proposition 4.9. As the proof of Proposition 4.9 is rather

long, we divide it into several steps:

Step 1. Necessary admissibility conditions for b, c, γ, m. In order to derive
the particular form of F and R with the above parameter restrictions, we
follow the approach of Keller-Ressel [34], Theorem 2.6. Note that the t-
derivative of Pte−hu,xi at t = 0 exists for all x, u ∈ S+

d , since

CUCHIERO, FILIPOVI ´C, MAYERHOFER AND TEICHMANN

For every ﬁxed t > 0, the right-hand side of (4.4) is the logarithm of the
Laplace transform of a compound Poisson distribution supported on S+
d −
R+x with intensity pt(x, S+
d )/t and compounding distribution pt(x, dξ +
x)/pt(x, S+
d ). Concerning the support, note that the compounding distri-
bution is concentrated on S+
d − x, which implies that the compound Poisson
distribution has support on the convex cone S+
d − R+x. By Lemma 4.5, the
pointwise convergence of (4.4) for t → 0 to some function being continu-
ous at 0, implies weak convergence of the compound Poisson distributions
to some inﬁnitely divisible probability distribution K(x, dy) supported on
S+
d − R+x. Indeed, this follows from the fact that any compound Poisson
distribution is inﬁnitely divisible and the class of inﬁnitely divisible dis-
tributions is closed under weak convergence ([47], Lemma 7.8). Again, by
Lemma 4.5 the Laplace transform of K(x, dy) is then given as exponential
of the left-hand side of (4.4).

In particular, for x = 0, K(0, dy) is an inﬁnitely divisible distribution with
d . By the L´evy–Khintchine formula on proper cones

support on the cone S+
(see [49], Theorem 3.21), its Laplace transform is therefore of the form

exp(cid:18)−hb, ui +ZS+

d \{0}

(e−hu,ξi − 1)m(dξ)(cid:19),

where b ∈ S+

d and m is a Borel measure supported on S+

d such that

yielding (2.7). Therefore,

F (u) = hb, ui + c −ZS+

d \{0}

(e−hu,ξi − 1)m(dξ).

Step 2. Necessary admissibility conditions for βij, µ. We next obtain the

particular form of R. Observe that for each x ∈ S+

d and k ∈ N,

exp(−(F (u) − c)/k − hR(u) − γ, xi)

k denotes the 1

is the Laplace transform of the inﬁnitely divisible distribution K(kx, dy)∗1/k,
where ∗ 1
k convolution power. For k → ∞, these Laplace
transforms obviously converge to exp(−hR(u) − γ, xi) pointwise in u. Us-
ing again the same arguments as before [an application of Lemma 4.5 as
below (4.4)], we can deduce that K(kx, dy)∗1/k converges weakly to some
inﬁnitely divisible distribution L(x, dy) on S+
d − R+x with Laplace trans-
form exp(−hR(u) − γ, xi) for u ∈ S+
d .
By the L´evy–Khintchine formula on Sd ([47], Theorem 8.1, indeed on
R(d(d+1)/2) by modifying the scalar product appropriately), the characteristic

Therefore, the characteristic function bL(x, u) admits an analytic extension
to S+
u ∈ S+

that x 7→ A(x), x 7→ B(x) as well as x 7→RE(kξk2 ∧ 1)M (x, dξ) for every

CUCHIERO, FILIPOVI ´C, MAYERHOFER AND TEICHMANN

From these arguments and Lemma 4.1, properties (2.11) and (2.9) can be
derived so far. Thus, only (2.3) remains to be shown.

Step 3. Necessary admissibility condition for α. Due to the linearity of
A(x), hu, A(x)ui can be written as 4hx, ϑ(u)i, where the (ij)th component
of ϑ(u) ∈ Sd is deﬁned by ϑij(u) = 1/4hu, aij ui. Note that ϑ is deﬁned on
all of Sd. Given that for all x ∈ S+
d , A(x) is a positive semideﬁnite operator
on Sd, hu, A(x)ui ≥ 0 for all u ∈ Sd and therefore, by the self duality of S+
d ,
ϑ(u) ∈ S+
(4.15)

d . By (4.12), we have for all u such that ux = xu = 0

0 = hu, A(x)ui = 4hx, ϑ(u)i.

Next, we show that ϑ is quasi-constant, that is, hx, ϑ(u+ w)− ϑ(u)i = 0 for
all x, u, w ∈ S+
d with hx, wi = 0 (see Deﬁnition 4.7). Indeed, pick x, u, w ∈ S+
with hx, wi = 0. According to our assumptions, A(x)w = 0, due to (4.15) and
the positivity of A. Hence,

d

4hx, ϑ(u + w) − ϑ(u)i = hu + w, A(x)(u + w)i − hu, A(x)ui

= hu, A(x)wi + hA(x)w, ui = 0,

where the second last equality holds in view of the symmetry of A(x).

We now claim that there exists some α ∈ S+

d such that ϑ(u) = uαu, for
each u ∈ Sd. It is suﬃcient to show that this statements holds for all or-
thogonal projectors p ∈ S+
d , that is, there exists some α ∈ S+
d such that
ϑ(p) = pαp for all orthogonal projectors p. Indeed, if this is the case, we can
derive the general statement in the following way: take u ∈ S+
d , then—by
spectral decomposition—there are numbers λi ≥ 0 and orthogonal projec-
tors pi, which are mutually orthogonal, such that u =Pd
i=1 λipi (see, e.g.,
Kato [33], Section I.6.9). Since the assertion holds for all orthogonal projec-
tors, we have that

2ϑ(u) =

dXi,j=1

λiλj(ϑ(pi + pj) − ϑ(pi) − ϑ(pj))

by the property that ϑ is quadratic. Since pi + pj is again an orthogonal
projector, we obtain the result.

We prove the assertion on orthogonal projectors by quasi-constancy. Take
an arbitrary orthogonal projector p and deﬁne q = Id − p. Additionally, we
deﬁne α = ϑ(Id). By quasi-constancy, we obtain

hx, ϑ(p + q) − ϑ(q)i = hy, ϑ(p + q) − ϑ(p)i = 0

and

hx, ϑ(p)i = hy, ϑ(q)i = 0,

for all x, y ∈ S+
are orthogonal to the orthogonal complement of p in S+

d with hx, pi = 0 and hy, qi = 0. Therefore, α − ϑ(q) and ϑ(p)
d (i.e., the positive

AFFINE PROCESSES ON POSITIVE SEMIDEFINITE MATRICES

29

symmetric matrices of the form quq by Lemma 4.2), and α − ϑ(p) and ϑ(q)
are orthogonal to the orthogonal complement of q in S+
d (the positive sym-
metric matrices of the form pup by Lemma 4.2). This means that we can
write

α = ϑ(p) + ϑ(q) + β,

where the symmetric matrix β is orthogonal to all elements which are or-
thogonal to p and q (in S+
d ), that is, β is orthogonal to the linear span of
matrices of the form pup and quq. However, such a decomposition is unique,
since all vectors in the sum are mutually orthogonal, and the decomposition
is given by

α = (p + q)α(p + q) = pαp + qαq + (pαq + qαp).

Therefore, we can conclude the assertion ϑ(p) = pαp. Since p was arbitrary
the assertion is proved.

Finally, all the derived restrictions on the parameters together with (4.6)

then yield (2.17). (cid:3)

Remark 4.11. An alternative proof for the special form of the diﬀusion
matrix A(x) can also be established by Stokes’ theorem [50] on Riccati
ODEs.

4.2. Inﬁnitesimal generator. The aim of this section is to prove the form

of the inﬁnitesimal generator as stated in (2.12).

Proposition 4.12. The inﬁnitesimal generator A of an aﬃne process
on S+
d satisﬁes S+ ⊂ D(A) and is of the form (2.12) for all f ∈ S+ and
x ∈ S+
d .

Proof. As already mentioned in the proof of Proposition 4.9, the t-
d and is given
d ), for u ∈
d ), it follows from [47], Lemma

derivative of Pte−hu,xi at t = 0 exists pointwise for all x, u ∈ S+
by (4.3). Furthermore, x 7→ (−F (u) − hR(u), xi)e−hu,xi ∈ C0(S+

where the empty product is deﬁned to be 1.

Proof.

In dimension d = 2, the assertion is easily checked, as det(y) =

y11y22 − y12y21. Therefore, we have

∂11 det(y) = y22,

∂22 det(y) = y11,

∂12 det(y) = ∂21 det(y) = 0

as well as

∂2
11 det(y) = ∂2

22 det(y) = ∂2

12 det(y) = ∂2

21 det(y) = 0,

∂12 ∂21 det(y) = ∂21 ∂12 det(y) = −1.

For dimension strictly larger than 2, we employ a combinatorial argument.
Recall Leibniz’s deﬁnition of the determinant,

(4.22)

det(x) =Xσ∈Σ

sgn(σ)

xkσ(k),

dYk=1

where σ is an element of the permutation group Σ on the set {1, 2, . . . , d}
and sgn denotes the signum function on Σ, that is, sgn = 1 if σ is an even
permutation and sgn = −1 if it is odd. Diﬀerentiation of (4.22) with respect
to xij yields

=(cid:18)Xσ∈Σ

ists a unique aﬃne process on S+

problem for the operator A. In order to prove uniqueness for this martingale
problem, we shall need the following existence and uniqueness result for the
generalized Riccati diﬀerential equations (2.14) and (2.15).

Now let δ > 0, and deﬁne

µ(dξ)(cid:19)

Now, the map u 7→ −2uαu + γ is quasi-monotone increasing, as it is shown
in Step 3 of the proof of Proposition 4.9. Furthermore, it follows from the
admissibility condition (2.11) that

u 7→ B⊤(u) −Z{kξk≥δ}

hχ(ξ), ui
kξk2 ∧ 1

µ(dξ)

is a quasi-monotone increasing linear map on S+
of

d . Finally, the quasi-monotonicity

u 7→Z{kξk≥δ}(cid:18) 1 − e−hu,ξi

kξk2 ∧ 1 (cid:19)µ(dξ)

is a consequence of the monotonicity of the exponential and that supp(µ) ⊆
S+
d .
By dominated convergence, we have limδ→0 Rδ(u) = R(u) pointwise for
d . Hence, the quasi-monotonicity carries over to R. Indeed, choose
such that u (cid:22) v and hv − u, xi = 0. Then we have for all δ,
d

each u ∈ S+
x, u, v ∈ S+
hRδ(v) − Rδ(u), xi ≥ 0. Thus,

hRδ(v) − Rδ(u), xi → hR(v) − R(u), xi ≥ 0,

as δ → 0, which proves that R is quasi-monotone increasing. (cid:3)

from which we derive the existence of a positive constant K such equation
(5.1) holds. (cid:3)

Here is our main existence and uniqueness result for the generalized Ric-

cati diﬀerential equations (2.14) and (2.15).

Proposition 5.3. For every u ∈ S++

It thus remains to show that t+(u) = ∞. That ψ(t, u), and hence φ(t, u), is
analytic in (t, u) ∈ R+ × S++

we ﬁrst have to regularize it. We thus deﬁne

It then follows as in Lemmas 5.1 and 5.2 that eR is quasi-monotone increasing

Sd. Hence, for all u ∈ Sd, there exists a unique local Sd-valued solution eψ of

eψ(0, u) = u,
for all t ∈ [0,et+(u)) with maximal lifetime
n→∞{t ≥ 0 | keψ(t, u)k ≥ n} ≤ ∞.
From (5.1), we infer that for all u ∈ S+

et+(u) = lim inf

Gronwall’s inequality (e.g., [14], (10.5.1.3)) implies

∂t − eR(eψ(t, u)) =

We now carry this over to ψ(t, u) and assume without loss of generality,
as in the proof of Lemma 5.2, that the truncation function in Deﬁnition 2.3
takes the form χ(ξ) = 1{kξk≤1}ξ. Then

Hence, t+(u) = lim inf n→∞{t ≥ 0 | kψ(t, u)k ≥ n}. Using (5.1) again, we now

can show as for eψ that
Hence t+(u) = ∞, as desired. (cid:3)

kψ(t, u)k2 ≤ eKt(kuk2 + 1),

t < t+(u).

Remark 5.4. Lemma 5.1 states that the admissibility of the parame-
ters α, βij, γ, µ implies quasi-monotonicity of R on S+
d .9 Moreover, quasi-
monotonicity just means that R is “inward pointing” close to the boundary
d . Indeed, let u, x ∈ S+
S+
d with hu, xi = 0. Then hR(u), xi ≥ hγ, xi ≥ 0. Hence,
if R were Lipschitz continuous on S+
d , a deterministic variant of Theorem
A.5 would imply the invariance of S+
d with respect to (2.15) right away. How-
ever, the map R might fail to be Lipschitz at ∂S+
d (see the one-dimensional
counterexample [16], Example 9.3), even though it is analytic on the inte-
rior S++
. Here, quasi-monotonicity plays the decisive role. It leads to the
phenomenon that ψ(t, u) stays away from the boundary ∂S+
d for u ∈ S++
,
which is of crucial importance in our analysis.

5.2. The martingale problem for A. We are now prepared to study the
martingale problem for the operator A given by (2.12). For the notion of
martingale problems, we refer to [17], Chapter 4. We shall proceed in four
steps. First, we approximate A by regular operators Aε,δ,n on the space S+
of rapidly decreasing C∞-functions on S+
d , deﬁned in (B.1). Second, using
Theorem A.5 below, we show that there exists an S+
d -valued c`adl`ag solution
of the martingale problem for Aε,δ,n. Third, a subsequence of these solutions
is shown to converge to an S+
d ∪{∆}-valued c`adl`ag solution of the martingale
problem for A. Finally, we show that this solution is unique, Markov and
aﬃne, as desired.
Note that we cannot employ Stroock’s [51] seminal existence and unique-
ness results for martingale problems, since those are solved on Rn and require
uniform elliptic diﬀusion parts. Neither of these is satisﬁed in our case.

Now let (α, b, βij, c = 0, γ = 0, m, µ) be some admissible parameter set. Fix
some ε, δ > 0 and n ∈ N. In order to bound the coeﬃcients and cut oﬀ the
small jumps, we let

ϕn ∈ C∞b (Sd),

0 ≤ ϕn ≤ 1,

(5.4)

ϕn(x) =( 1,

kxk ≤ n,
kxk ≥ n + 1.

9We conjecture that the converse also holds: R is quasi-monotone on S+

d and supp(µ) ⊆

S+

We then deﬁne the bounded and smooth parameters

Concerning the diﬀusion function Aijkl(x) given by (2.13), we ﬁrst ﬁnd
an appropriate factorization which will allow us to write the continuous
martingale part of X as a stochastic integral. Thereto observe that any S+
d -
valued solution, presumed that it exists, of the following symmetric matrix-
valued diﬀusion SDE:

(5.5)

dZt =pZt dWt Σ + Σ⊤ dW ⊤t pZt,

where W is a standard d × d-matrix Brownian motion and Σ ∈ Md with
Σ⊤Σ = α, has quadratic variation dhZij, Zklit = Aijkl(Zt). Deﬁne now σkl(x) ∈
Sd by

(5.6)

σkl(x) = √xM klΣ + Σ⊤M lk√x,

where M kl

Since σkl(x) involves the matrix square root, which is neither Lipschitz
continuous nor bounded nor globally deﬁned, we need to introduce some
approximating regularization in order to meet the assumptions of Theorem
A.5 below. Thereto ﬁx some truncation function

• limε→0+ sε,n(x) =pϕn(x)x.

observe that for every n

kf (x + ξ)xij(ϕn(x) − 1)k ≤ kf (x + ξ)xijk ≤ kf (x + ξ)kkx + ξk,

such that we can apply dominated convergence. Again, since f lies in S+,
the ﬁrst integral converges uniformly in x to 0 as well. Hence (5.11) holds
true, and S ⊂ D(Aε,δ,n) follows similarly. (cid:3)

Since we take the derivative at t = 0, we only have to consider

Let us now verify (5.17). Take an arbitrary x = OΛO⊤ ∈ ∂S+

ﬁrst that it has rank d − 1, that is, λd = 0 and all other eigenvalues are
strictly positive. By Lemma 4.1 and (2.23), the elements of NS+

then be written as u = OKO⊤, where K = diag(0, . . . , 0, k) with k ≥ 0. Thus,

Combining Lemmas 5.5 and 5.6, we obtain the announced existence result

solution X to the martingale problem for A with X0 = x. That is,

for the martingale problem for A.
Lemma 5.8. For every x ∈ S+
f (Xt) −Z t

is a martingale, for all f ∈ S+.

Proof. By Lemma 5.6, there exists a solution X ε,δ,n to the martingale
problem for Aε,δ,n with sample paths in D(S+
d -valued
c`adl`ag paths), and hence also in D(S+
d ∪ {∆}). We now claim that (X ε,δ,n)
is relatively compact considered as a sequence of processes with sample
paths in D(S+
d ∪{∆}).10 For the proof of this assertion, we shall make use of
Theorems 9.1 and 9.4 in Chapter 3 of [17]. In order to meet the assumption
of [17], Chapter 3, Theorem 9.4, we take C∞c (S+
d ) as subalgebra of Cb(S+
d ).
Then, for every T > 0 and f ∈ C∞c (S+
d ), we have

d ) (the space of S+

since there exists a constant C such that kAε,δ,nfk∞ ≤ Cp3,+(f ) < ∞ for all
n, ε, δ, where pk,+ are the semi-norms as deﬁned in (B.2) (see also the proof
of Proposition 4.12). Thus, the requirements of [17], Chapter 3, Theorem
9.4, are satisﬁed. Note that Y in the notation of [17], Chapter 3, Theorem
9.4, corresponds in our case to f (X) such that [17], Chapter 3, Condition
(9.17), is automatically fulﬁlled. It then follows by the conclusion of [17],
Chapter 3, Theorem 9.4, that (f (X ε,δ,n
)) is relatively compact [as family of
processes with sample paths in D(R)] for each f ∈ C∞c (S+
d ). Furthermore,
since we consider S+
d ∪ {∆}, the compact containment condition is always
satisﬁed, that is, for every η > 0 and T > 0, there exists a compact set

holds true. By [17], Chapter 3, Theorem 9.1, and the fact that {1, C∞c (S+
d )} is
dense in C(S+
d ∪{∆}), we therefore obtain that (X ε,δ,n) is relatively compact
in D(S+
d ∪ {∆}). Thus, there exists a subsequence (Pεk,δk,nk) of the proba-
bility distributions associated to (X ε,δ,n) which converges in the Prohorov
metric to some limit probability distribution. By [17], Chapter 3, Theorem
3.1, this implies weak convergence of (Pεk,δk,nk ) and hence the subsequence
(X εk,δk,nk) converges in distribution to some limit process X in D(S+
d ∪{∆}).
Combining this with Lemma 5.5 and [17], Chapter 4, Lemma 5.1, we
conclude that X is a solution to the martingale problem for A. Hence, the
lemma is proved. (cid:3)

We can now prove the existence and uniqueness of an aﬃne process for

any admissible parameter set.

Proposition 5.9. Let (α, b, βij , c, γ, m, µ) be an admissible parameter
d with inﬁnitesimal gen-
d , where φ(t, u) and

set. Then there exists a unique aﬃne process on S+
erator (2.12), and (2.1) holds for all (t, u) ∈ R+ × S+
ψ(t, u) are given by (2.14) and (2.15).

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that c = 0 and γ = 0. Let x ∈ S+

d . Then Lemma
5.8 implies the existence of an S+
d ∪ {∆}-valued c`adl`ag solution X of the
martingale problem for A with X0 = x. We now show that X is unique in
distribution.

Thereto, note that by [17], Chapter 4, Theorem 7.1,

(5.18)

(Af (s, Xs) + ∂sf (s, Xs)) ds

f (t, Xt) −Z t

is a martingale for all rapidly decreasing functions f ∈ S(R+× S+
d ), similarly
deﬁned as S+ in (B.1). Now let φ and ψ be the unique solutions of the gener-
alized Riccati diﬀerential equations (2.14) and (2.15), given by Proposition
5.3. Fix t > 0, u ∈ S++

, and some f ∈ S(R+ × S+

d ) such that
0 ≤ s ≤ t, x ∈ S+
d .

f (s, x) = e−φ(t−s,u)−hψ(t−s,u),xi,

Then

Af (s, x) + ∂sf (s, x) = 0,

0 ≤ s ≤ t, x ∈ S+
d .

In view of (5.18), the Laplace transform of Xt at u is thus given by
Ex[e−hu,Xti] = Ex[f (t, Xt)] = f (0, x) − 0 = e−φ(t,u)−hψ(t,u),xi.

(5.19)
Since u ∈ S++
d was arbitrary, we conclude that the distribution of Xt is
uniquely determined for all t > 0. From [17], Chapter 4, Theorem 4.2, we
infer that X is a Markov process with generator A on S+ and thus unique in

law as solution of the martingale problem for A. Moreover, by (5.19), X is
stochastically continuous and aﬃne. Thus, the proposition is proved under
the premise that c = 0 and γ = 0.

For general parameters c and γ, we employ a Feynman–Kac argument.
Denote by B and (Qt) the aﬃne generator and corresponding Feller semi-
group associated with (α, b, βij , c = 0, γ = 0, m, µ) from the ﬁrst part of the
proof, respectively. Since x 7→ c +hγ, xi is nonnegative on S+

the lines of [16], Proposition 11.1, that

cesses without diﬀusion component (i.e., the admissible parameter α van-

ternative existence proof in this speciﬁc case, by following the lines of [16].
Note that the OU-type processes driven by matrix L´evy subordinators [3]
are contained in the class of pure jump processes of this section.

We call a function f : S+

Once again, we recall that a distribution on S+

d \{0}

d is inﬁnitely divisible if
and only if its Laplace transform takes the form e−f (u), where f is of the
above form (see also Step 1 in the proof of Proposition 4.9).

Similarly to [16], we introduce the sets
C := {f + c | f : S+
CS := {ψ | u 7→ hψ(u), xi ∈ C for all x ∈ S+
d }.

d → R is of L´evy–Khintchine form on S+

d , c ∈ R+},

The following technical statement can be obtained easily by mimicking the
proofs of the corresponding statements in [16], Proposition 7.2 and Lemma
7.5:

Lemma 5.10. We have:
(i) C, CS are convex cones in C(S+
d ).

(ii) φ ∈ C, ψ ∈ CS imply φ(ψ) ∈ C.
(iii) ψ, ψ1 ∈ CS imply ψ1(ψ) ∈ CS .
(iv) If φk ∈ C converges to a continuous function φ on S+
d , then φ ∈ C.
A similar statement holds for sequences in CS.
(v) Let (α = 0, b, βij, c, γ, m, µ) be an admissible parameter set. Then
Rδ → R locally uniformly as δ → 0, where Rδ corresponds to the admis-
sible parameter set (α = 0, b, βij, c, γ, m, µ1{kξk≥δ}). (Note that there is one
ﬁxed truncation function.)

Proposition 5.11. Let (α = 0, b, βij, c, γ, m, µ) be an admissible param-
eter set. Then for all t ≥ 0, the solutions (φ(t,·), ψ(t,·)) of (2.14) and (2.15)
lie in (C,CS).

Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that11

e eB⊤t being a positive semi-group, that is, e eB⊤t maps S+

Due to admissibility condition (2.11), we have that eB⊤ is a linear drift
e eB⊤t ∈ CS and since eR(u) is given by
eR(u) = γ −ZS+

Using Picard’s iteration and Lemma 5.10, it follows that the sequence

the former, since Rδ clearly satisﬁes (5.20). (cid:3)

We are prepared to provide an alternative proof of Proposition 5.9 un-
der the additional assumption α = 0: by Proposition 5.11, (φ(t,·), ψ(t,·))
lie in (C,CS). Hence for all t ≥ 0, x ∈ S+
d , there exists an inﬁnitely divisible
sub-stochastic kernel pt(x, dξ) with Laplace-transform e−φ(t,u)−hψ(t,u),xi. The
Chapman–Kolmogorov equations hold in view of properties (3.1) and (3.2).
Whence, Proposition 5.9 follows.

Remark 5.12. We note that the proof of statement (v) in Lemma 5.10 is
much easier than the one of [16], Lemma 7.5, because α = 0. However, for α 6=
0 and d ≥ 2, R cannot be locally uniformly approximated by functions Rδ of
a pure jump type such as in Lemma 5.10. Indeed, otherwise one could infer
as above the existence of an aﬃne process which is inﬁnitely decomposable
and has nonvanishing diﬀusion component. This is in contradiction with
Proposition 2.9 and in the case of pure diﬀusions it contradicts Example
2.8.

6. Proof of the main results.

6.1. Proof of Theorem 2.4. The ﬁrst part is a summary of Propositions

3.4, 4.9, 4.12 and 4.18. The second part follows from Proposition 5.9.

6.2. Proof of Theorem 2.6. Let X be a conservative aﬃne process. It is

shown in Proposition 4.12 that {e−hu,·i | u ∈ S++

d } ⊂ D(A). Hence,

e−hu,Xti − e−hu,xi −Z t

is a (eFt, Px)-martingale with eFt deﬁned in (2.18). From [31], Theorem II.2.42,

combined with (4.16) and Remark 2.5, it then follows that X is a semi-
martingale with characteristics (2.19)–(2.21). The canonical semimartingale

representation ([31], Theorem II.2.34) of X is thus given by

where X c denotes the continuous martingale part, and µX the random mea-
sure associated with the jumps of X. In order to establish representation
(2.22), we ﬁnd it convenient to consider the vectorization, vec(X c) ∈ Rd2
,
of X c. The aim is now to ﬁnd a d2-dimensional Brownian motion fW on a
possibly enlarged probability space and a d2 × d2-matrix-valued function σ
such that

terms of σkl(x) given in (5.6) by

(6.3)

σijkl(x) = σkl

ij (x) = √xikΣlj + Σ⊤il√xjk.

Note that the (kl)th column of σ(x) is just the vectorization of the ma-
trix σkl(x). We thus obtain Aijkl(x) = (σ(x)σ⊤(x))ijkl. Hence, σ(x) satisﬁes
(6.2). Analogous to the proof of [45], Theorem 20.1, we can now build a

d2-dimensional Brownian motion fW on an enlargement of the probability

space such that (6.1) holds true. As the (ij)th entry of X c is given by

6.3. Proof of Theorem 2.9. We ﬁrst prove some technical lemmas.

Lemma 6.1. Let g : S+

Cauchy’s functional equation

d → R be an additive function, that is, g satisﬁes

g(x + y) = g(x) + g(y),

(6.4)
Then g can be extended to an additive function f : Sd → R. Moreover, if g is
measurable on S+
d then f is measurable on Sd. In that case, f is a continuous
linear functional, that is, f (x) = hc, xi for some c ∈ Sd.

x, y ∈ S+
d .

Proof. The ﬁrst part follows from Lemma 4.4.
Concerning measurability, let E ∈ B(R), a Borel measurable set. Then we

have by the additivity of f ,

{x + nId | x ∈ Sd, f (x) ∈ E,kxk ≤ n} − nId

which is again a measurable set, in view of the measurability of g on S+
d .

For x ∈ Sd we write x = (xi)i, where 1 ≤ i ≤ d(d+1)

. We introduce the
additive functions fi : R → R via fi(xi) = f (0, . . . , 0, xi, 0, . . . , 0). By the just
proved measurability of f , we infer that all fi are measurable functions on
R. By [1], Chapter 2, Theorem 8, any additive measurable function on the
real line is a continuous linear functional. Hence for each i, we infer the

existence of ci ∈ R such that fi(xi) = cixi holds. Since f (x) =Pi fi(xi), it

follows that f (x) = hc, xi for some c ∈ Sd. (cid:3)

2

Also, we consider Cauchy’s exponential equation for h : S+

d → R+, that is,

(6.5)

h(x + y) = h(x)h(y),

x, y ∈ S+
d .

Lemma 6.2. Suppose h : S+

d → R+ is measurable, strictly positive, and
satisﬁes (6.5). Then h(x) = e−hc,xi, for some c ∈ Sd. If h ≤ 1, then c ∈ S+
d .
Proof. Since h is strictly positive, its logarithm yields the well deﬁned
d → R, g(x) := log h(x). Clearly g is additive, hence by the

function g : S+

AFFINE PROCESSES ON POSITIVE SEMIDEFINITE MATRICES

55

ﬁrst part of Lemma 6.1, there exists a unique additive extension f : Sd → R.
Also, f is measurable on S+
d , hence by the second assertion of Lemma 6.1
we have f (x) = −hc, xi, for some c ∈ Sd. The last statement follows from the
monotonicity of the exponential and the self duality of S+

d . (cid:3)

Remark 6.3. The assumption of strict positivity of h in the preceding
lemma is essential. Otherwise, there exist solutions h which are not of the
asserted form.

Lemma 6.2 is the main ingredient of the proof of the following character-

ization concerning k-fold convolutions of Markov processes.

k > 1, N > 1, t, u and set

g(j)(x) := E(j)

x [e−PN

i=1hu(i),Xtii].

By the deﬁnition of the convolution, (6.6) is equivalent to the following:

g(1)(x(1)) · ··· · g(k)(x(k)) = g(0)(x)

x = x(1) + ··· + x(k).
Hence, the implication (6.7) ⇒ (6.8) is obvious. For the converse direction,
we observe that g(i) are strictly positive on all of S+
d . Thus, by (6.8) we have

∀x(i) ∈ S+
d ,

g := g(1)/g(1)(0) = ··· = g(k)/g(k)(0) = g(0)/g(0)(0)

and g is a measurable, strictly positive function on S+
satisfying (6.5).
d
Hence, an application of Lemma 6.2 yields the validity of (6.7), where
ρ(i)(t, u) = g(i)(0). By the deﬁnition of g(i), it follows that 0 < ρ(i)(t, u) ≤ 1
and ψ(t, u) ∈ S+

(iii) ⇒ (i): by deﬁnition, every transition kernel pt(x, dξ) of X is inﬁnitely
divisible with Laplace transform Pte−hu,xi = e−φ(t,u)−hx,ψ(t,u)i. For each k ≥
1, the maps φ(k) := φ
k , ψ(k) := ψ satisfy the properties (3.1) and (3.2). Also,
inﬁnite divisibility implies that for each (t, x) ∈ R+ × S+
d ,
t e−hu,xi := e−φ(k)(t,u)−hψ(k)(t,u),x/ki

Q(k)

is the Laplace transform of a sub-stochastic measure on S+
d . In conjunction
with Properties (3.1) and (3.2) we may conclude that Q(k)
gives rise to a
Feller semigroup on C0(S+
d ), which is aﬃne in y = x/k. Hence, we have
constructed for each k ≥ 1 a kth root of X which is stochastic continuous by
the deﬁnition of its characteristic exponents φ(k), ψ(k). Thus Theorem 2.9 is
proved.

We further assume that x 7→ K(x, Rn) is bounded.
We tackle this problem in three steps. First, we derive some regularity and
existence results for diﬀusion SDEs. These results are not in the standard
literature, we thus provide full proofs. Second, we prove existence of a c`adl`ag
solution X for (A.1). Finally, we provide suﬃcient conditions for X to be
D-valued.

solution of (A.2) if X is continuous and (A.2) holds for all t ≥ 0 a.s. In
particular, note that this null set depends on (θ, x).

Lemma A.1. Fix T > 0 and let p ≥ 2. Furthermore, let Θ1, Θ2 be stop-

where K always denotes a constant which varies from line to line. The last
estimate in both inequalities follows from the the Lipschitz continuity of b
and σ. By assembling these pieces, the proof is complete. (cid:3)

Here is a fundamental existence result, which is not stated in this general

form in the standard literature. Therefore, we provide a full proof.

Theorem A.2. There exists a function Z : [0,∞] × Rn × Ω × R+ → Rn

with the following properties:

(i) Z(θ, x, ω, t) is continuous in (θ, x, t) for all ω.
(ii) Z is B([0,∞] × Rn) ⊗ P-measurable.12
12Here, P denotes the predictable σ-ﬁeld.

AFFINE PROCESSES ON POSITIVE SEMIDEFINITE MATRICES

(iii) Z(θ, x, ω, t) solves (A.2) for all (θ, x).
(iv) Let Θ be a stopping time and U an FΘ measurable random variable,

then Xt = Z(Θ, U, t) solves

(A.4)

Xt = U +Z t

σ(Xs)1{Θ≤s} dWs.

Proof. For every (θ, x) ∈ [0,∞] × Rn, there exists a unique solution
Xt(ω) = eZ(θ, x, ω, t) of (A.2), which is continuous in t. This is a conse-
quence of the Lipschitz continuity of x 7→ b(x)1{θ≤s} and x 7→ σ(x)1{θ≤s}.
Uniqueness is meant modulo indistinguishability. From estimate (A.3), we
can deduce for p ≥ 2, x, y ∈ [−T, T ]n, 0 ≤ θ1, θ2 ≤ T and 0 ≤ t ≤ T ,

Let now Dya = {j2−k, j ∈ Z, k ∈ N} be the set of dyadic rational numbers
in R and Dyan = Dya×··· × Dya the set of dyadic rational numbers in Rn.
Furthermore, we deﬁne M by M = Dyan+1 ∩([0, T ] × [−T, T ]n). By setting
p = 2n + 4, we can apply Kolmogorov’s lemma. Indeed, analogous to the
proof of [32], Theorem 2.8, we derive for all (θ1, x), (θ2, y) ∈ M with 0 <
k(θ1, x) − (θ2, y)k < h(ω), where h is a positive valued random variable, and
for all ω ∈ Ω∗T , where Ω∗T ∈ F is some set depending on T with P(Ω∗T ) = 1,

Here, γ ∈ (0, 1

if ω /∈ Ω∗T , then Z(θ, x, ω, t) = x for 0 ≤ t ≤ T . For ω ∈ Ω∗T and (θ, x) ∈
M , Z(θ, x, ω, t) = eZ(θ, x, ω, t) for 0 ≤ t ≤ T . If (θ, x) ∈ M c, we choose a
sequence (θn, xn)n∈N ⊆ M such that (θn, xn) → (θ, x). By estimate (A.5),
eZ(θn, xn, ω, t) is a Cauchy sequence converging with respect to sups≤tk · k.

is jointly continuous in (θ, x, t). Furthermore, for every (θ, x), Z is indistin-

We can therefore set Z(θ, x, ω, t) = limn→∞eZ(θn, xn, ω, t). As we have uni-
form convergence in t and as eZ is continuous in t, the resulting process Z
guishable from eZ, that is,

which implies that eZ(θn, xn, t) → eZ(θ, x, t) in probability, uniformly in t.
As eZ(θn, xn, t) → Z(θ, x, t) a.s., and thus in particular in probability, it fol-

assertion (i).

In order to prove (iv), we proceed in two steps:
Step 1. We ﬁrst assume that Θ and U take ﬁnitely many values θ1, . . . , θk ∈

we have (see, e.g., [36], page 39)

Step 2. For general Θ, U , approximate Θ(k) ↓ Θ by the simple stopping

Θ(k) =(cid:26) j2−k,

∞,

(j − 1)2−k ≤ Θ < j2−k, j = 1, . . . , k2k,
k ≤ Θ.

Let U (l) be a sequence of FΘ-measurable random variables, each U (l) tak-
ing ﬁnitely many values, and U (l) → U in L2 (such U (l) obviously exists).
Moreover, {Θ(k) = θj} ∩ {U (l) = xh} ∈ Fθj for all j, h (see [32], Chapter 1,
Problem 2.24).
By Step 1, each Z(Θ(k), U (l)) satisﬁes the respective SDE. Moreover, from
estimate (A.3) and Grownwall’s lemma we deduce that for any T > 0, there
exists a constant C such that

t≤TkZ(Θ(k), U (l), t) − Z(Θ(k′), U (l′), t)k2i
Ehsup
≤ CeCT E[kU (k) − U (k′)k2 + |Θ(k) ∧ T − Θ(k′) ∧ T|].

Hence, Z(Θ(k), U (l)) is a Cauchy sequence and thus converging with respect
to E[supt≤Tk · k2], for all T > 0, to some continuous process X satisfying
(A.4). On the other hand, by the continuity of (θ, x) 7→ Z(θ, x, t), we know
that

Z(Θ(k), U (l), t) → Z(Θ, U, t)

for all ω and t ≥ 0. Again, by continuity of t 7→ Z(Θ, U, t), we conclude that
Z(Θ, U ) = X up to indistinguishability, which proves the claim. (cid:3)

A.2. Existence of jump-diﬀusions. We now provide a constructive proof
for the existence of a solution of (A.1) on a speciﬁc stochastic basis which
is deﬁned as follows:
• (Ω,F, (Ft)t≥0) is a ﬁltered space, where Ω := Ω1 × Ω2, Ft := Gt ⊗ Ht and
F = G⊗H are precisely deﬁned below. Note that we do not have a measure
on (Ω,F) for the moment. The generic sample element will be denoted by
ω = (ω1, ω2) ∈ Ω.
• (Ω1,G, (Gt)t≥0, P1) is some ﬁltered probability space satisfying the usual
conditions and carrying an m-dimensional standard Brownian motion W .
We shall consider the above diﬀusion SDE (A.2) on Ω1 and thus obtain
the respective solution Z(θ, x, ω1, t) satisfying the regularity properties of
Theorem A.2.

62

• (Ω2,H) is the canonical space for Rn-valued marked point processes (see,
e.g., [30]): Ω2 consists of all c`adl`ag, piecewise constant functions ω2 : [0,
T∞(ω2)) → Rn with ω2(0) = 0 and T∞(ω2) = limn→∞ Tn(ω2) ≤ ∞, where
Tn(ω2), deﬁned by T0 = 0 and

Tn(ω2) := inf{t > Tn−1(ω2) | ω2(t) 6= ω2(t−)} ∧ ∞,

n ≥ 1,

are the successive jump times of ω2. We denote by

Jt(ω) = Jt(ω2) = ω2(t)

on [0, T∞(ω2))

the canonical jump process, and let Ht = σ(Js | s ≤ t) be its natural ﬁl-
tration with H = H∞. Note that Tn are (Ht) and (Ft)-stopping times if
interpreted as Tn(ω) = Tn(ω2).

The following statement is meant to be pointwise, referring to the ﬁltered

measure space (Ω,F, (Ft)) without reference to a probability measure.

Lemma A.3. Let Z(θ, x, ω1, t) be as of Theorem A.2. Then for an FTn -
measurable random variable U (ω1, ω2) the process Z(Tn(ω2), U (ω1, ω2), ω1, t)
is:

(i) continuous in t for all (ω1, ω2),
(ii) Ft-adapted on {Tn ≤ t}.
Proof. The ﬁrst assertion is a consequence of Theorem A.2(i). The
second one follows from the B([0,∞]× Rn)⊗P-measurability of Z(θ, x, ω1, t),
as stated in Theorem A.2(ii), and the fact that Tn and U are Ft-measurable
on {Tn ≤ t}. (cid:3)

Here is our existence result for (A.1).

Theorem A.4. There exists a c`adl`ag Ft-adapted process X and a prob-
ability measure P on (Ω,F) with P|G = P1, such that X is a solution of (A.1)
on (Ω,F, (Ft), P).

Proof. We follow the arguments in the proof of [21], Theorem 5.1,

which is based on [30], Theorem 3.6, and proceed in three steps.

Step 1. We start by solving (A.1) along every path ω2. To this end, let us

deﬁne recursively: ∆ω2(0) = ∆ω2(∞) = 0, X (0)

where x0 is any ﬁxed point in D ⊂ Rn and Z satisﬁes the properties of Theo-
rem A.2. By Lemma A.3, every X (n) is continuous in t for all (ω1, ω2) and Ft-
adapted on {Tn ≤ t} since X (n−1)
(ω1, ω2) + ∆ω2(Tn−1) is FTn -measurable.
Thus, the process

is c`adl`ag Ft-adapted and solves (A.1) on (Ω1,G, (Gt), P1) for t ∈ [0, T∞(ω2))
and any ﬁxed path ω2.
Step 2. It remains to show that there exists a probability measure P such
that K(Xt, dξ) is the compensator of J and P|G = P1 holds true. For this
purpose, we shall make use of [30], Theorem 3.6. Let us deﬁne the following
random measure ν by

ν(dt, dξ) =(cid:26) K(Xt, dξ) dt,

0,

t < T∞,
t ≥ T∞.

Observe that ν is predictable, since Xt is c`adl`ag and Ft-adapted. Theorem
3.6 in [30] now implies that there exists a unique probability kernel P2 from
Ω1 to H, such that ν is the compensator of the random measure µ associated
to the jumps of J . On (Ω,F) we then deﬁne the probability measure P by
P(dω) = P1(dω1)P2(ω1, dω2) whose restriction to G is equal to P1.
for all t ≥ 0. Note that W (ω) = W (ω1) is an (Ω,F, (Ft), P)-Brownian mo-
tion. This implies that Z(θ, x, ω, t) = Z(θ, x, ω1, t) is a solution of (A.2) on
(Ω,F, (Ft), P), satisfying the properties of Theorem A.2. It thus remains to
show that T∞ = ∞ P-a.s. Let µ be the random measure associated with the
jumps. As x 7→ K(x, Rn) is bounded, we have for all T ≥ 0,

Step 3. We ﬁnally show that X deﬁned by (A.7) solves (A.1) on (Ω,F, (Ft), P)

EP[µ([0, T ] × Rn)] = EP[ν([0, T ] × Rn)] = EP(cid:20)Z T

K(Xt, Rn) dt(cid:21) ≤ CT
for some constant C. This implies that µ([0, T ] × Rn) < ∞ a.s. for all T ≥ 0
and hence P[T∞ < ∞] = 0 or equivalently T∞ = ∞ a.s. (cid:3)

A.3. Viability of jump-diﬀusions. Consider a nonempty closed convex
set D ⊂ Rn. We now provide suﬃcient conditions for the solution X in
(A.7) to be D-valued. This result is based on [13], Theorem 4.1. We recall
the notion of the normal cone

(A.8)

ND(x) = {u ∈ Rn | hu, y − xi ≥ 0, for all y ∈ D}

of D at x ∈ D, consisting of inward pointing vectors. See, for example, [28],
Deﬁnition III.5.2.3, except for a change of the sign.

for all u ∈ ND(x) and x ∈ D, where σi denotes the ith column of σ. Then,
for every initial point x ∈ D, the process X deﬁned in (A.7) is a D-valued
solution of (A.1).

Proof. We have to show that Xt =Pn≥1 X (n)

APPENDIX B: AN APPROXIMATION LEMMA ON THE CONE OF

POSITIVE SEMIDEFINITE MATRICES

In this section, we deliver a diﬀerentiable variant of the Stone–Weierstrass
theorem for C∞-functions on S+
d . This approximation statement is essential
for the description of the generator of an aﬃne semigroup, as is elaborated
in Section 4.2.

We employ multi-index notation in the sequel. For n ≥ 1, a multi-index
is an element α = (α1, . . . , αn) ∈ Nn
0 having length |α| := α1 + ··· + αn. The
factorial is deﬁned by α! :=Qn
i=1 αi!. The partial order ≤ is understood
componentwise, and so are the elementary operations +,−. That is, α ≥ β
if and only if αi ≥ βi for i = 1, . . . , n. Moreover, for α ≥ β, the multinomial
coeﬃcient is deﬁned by
(cid:18) α
β(cid:19) :=
We deﬁne the monomial xα :=Qn
. Corresponding to a polynomial P (x) =P|α|≤k aαxα, we introduce
the diﬀerential operator P (∂) :=P|α|≤k aα
Let S = S(Sd) denote the locally convex space of rapidly decreasing C∞-
functions on Sd (see [46], Chapter 7), and deﬁne the space of rapidly de-

x∈S+

on C∞(Sd), where B≤r(y) = {z ∈ Sd | kz − yk ≤ r} denotes the closed ball
with radius r and center y. Note that pk,+ = pk,0. We ﬁrst give an alternative
description of S+.

Lemma B.1. We have

S+ = {f = G |S+

d

: G ∈ C∞(Sd) and ∃ε > 0 such that pk,ε(G) < ∞ ∀k ≥ 0}.

66

CUCHIERO, FILIPOVI ´C, MAYERHOFER AND TEICHMANN

Proof. The inclusion ⊆ is trivial. Hence, we prove ⊇. So let f = G |S+
for some G ∈ C∞(Sd) with pk,ε(G) < ∞ for all k ≥ 0 and some ε > 0.
We choose a standard molliﬁer ρ ∈ C∞c (Sd) supported in B≤ε/2(0) and
satisfying ρ ≥ 0, R ρ = 1. For δ > 0 we introduce the neighborhoods Kδ :=
S+
d + B≤δ(0) of S+
d . The convolution ϕ := ρ∗ 1Kε/2 ∈ C∞(Sd) of the indicator
function for Kε/2 with ρ satisﬁes ϕ = 1 on S+
d and it vanishes outside Kε.
Furthermore, all derivatives of ϕ are bounded, since

d

|∂αϕ(x)| =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ZKε/2

∂αρ(y − x) dy(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) =(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)ZKε/2−x

≤ZB≤ε/2(0) |∂αρ(z)| dz < ∞,

∂αρ(z) dz(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Now we set F := G · ϕ. By construction F ∈ C∞(Sd), F |S+

where the last estimate holds because supp ρ ⊆ B≤ε/2(0).
= f and F
vanishes outside Kε, because ϕ does. What is left to show is that F ∈ S.
Since F vanishes outside Kε, it is suﬃcient to deliver all estimates of its
derivatives on Kε.

d

Let α, β ∈ N

d(d+1)/2

, then we have by the Leibniz rule

xα ∂βF (x) = xα X0≤γ≤β(cid:18) β
= X0≤γ≤β(cid:18) β

γ(cid:19) (∂β−γ ϕ(x))(∂γ G(x))
γ(cid:19) (∂β−γϕ(x))(xα ∂γ G(x)).

By assumption xα ∂γ G is bounded on Kε, and (∂β−γ ϕ(x)) is bounded on all
of Sd. Hence, by the last equation, we have supx∈Sd,|α+β|≤k|xα ∂βF (x)| < ∞
for all k ∈ N0, which by deﬁnition means F ∈ S. (cid:3)

Lemma B.2. Let u ∈ S++

d

. Then for each ε ≥ 0, and for all k ≥ 0 we

have pk,ε(exp(−hu,·i)) < ∞. In particular, we have
d ∈ S+.

fu := exp(−hu,·i)|S+

That is, fu = Fu |S+

for some Fu ∈ S.

Proof. Since u ∈ S++

culation, pk,+(exp(−hu,·i)) < ∞, for all k ≥ 0.

, there exists a positive constant c such that
d . Hence, we obtain by a straightforward cal-

Next, let ε > 0, and write x = y + z, where y ∈ S+

d and z ∈ B≤ε(0) and
. Then we have by the binomial formula

d(d+1)/2

γ(cid:19) (yαe−hu,yi)(zα−γe−hu,zi).

d

Now since z ranges in a compact set, and since pk,+(exp(−hu,·i)) < ∞ we
see that xα∂βe−hu,xi must be bounded uniformly in x ∈ S+
d + B≤ε(0). Hence,
pk,ε(exp(−hu,·i)) < ∞, for all k ≥ 0.

Together with Lemma B.1, this implies fu ∈ S+. (cid:3)
We are now prepared to deliver the following density result for the R-

, u ∈ S++

d } in S+.

linear hull M of {fu = exp(−hu,·i)|S+
Theorem B.3. M is dense in S+.
Proof. Denote by S′ = S′(Sd) and S′+ the topological dual of S and
S+, respectively. The former, S′, is known as the space of tempered distri-
butions. The distributional action is denoted by h·,·i and h·,·i+ for S′ and
S′+, respectively.
Now suppose by contradiction, that M is not dense in S+. Then by [46],
Theorem 3.5, there exists some T1 ∈ S′+ \{0} such that T1 = 0 on M. Hence,
hT1, fui+ = 0, for all u ∈ S++
yields a continuous
linear embedding S ֒→ S+. Hence, the restriction T of T1 to S, given by

. The restriction F 7→ F|S+

ϕ ∈ S(Sd),

hT, ϕi := hT1, ϕ|S+

yields an element of S′ with supp(T ) ⊆ S+
d . Pick an Fu ∈ S according to Lem-
ma B.2. By the deﬁnition of T , we have hT, Fui = hT1, fui+ = 0, for all u ∈
S++
. By the Bros–Epstein–Glaser theorem (see [42], Theorem IX.15), there
exists a function G ∈ C(Sd) with supp(G) ⊆ S+
d , polynomially bounded [i.e.,
for suitable constants C, N we have |G(x)| ≤ C(1 + kxk)N , for all x ∈ S+
d ]
and a real polynomial P (x) such that P (∂)G = T in S′. Hence, we obtain
for any u ∈ S++
=ZS+

G(x)P (−∂)Fu(x) dx = P (u)ZS+

But the last factor is just the Laplace transform of G. This implies G = 0,
hence T = 0, which in turn implies that T1 vanishes on all of S+, a contra-
diction. (cid:3)
