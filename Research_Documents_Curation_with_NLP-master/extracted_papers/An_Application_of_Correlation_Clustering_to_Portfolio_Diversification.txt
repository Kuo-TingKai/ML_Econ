Abstract

This paper presents a novel application of a clustering algorithm
developed for constructing a phylogenetic network to the correlation
matrix for 126 stocks listed on the Shanghai A Stock Market. We
show that by visualizing the correlation matrix using a Neighbor-Net
network and using the circular ordering produced during the construc-
tion of the network we can reduce the risk of a diversiﬁed portfolio
compared with random or industry group based selection methods in
times of market increase.

Introduction

Portfolio diversiﬁcation is critical for risk management because it aims to
reduce the variance in returns compared with a portfolio of a single stock or
similarly undiversiﬁed portfolio. The academic literature on diversiﬁcation is

1

vast, stretching back at least as far as Lowenfeld (1909). The modern science
of diversiﬁcation is usually traced to Markowtiz (1952) which is expanded
upon in great detail in Markowitz (1991).

The literature covers a wide range of approaches to portfolio diversiﬁcation,
such as; the number of stocks required to form a well diversiﬁed portfolio,
which has increased from eight stocks in the late 1960’s (Evans and Archer,
1968) to over 100 stocks in the late 2000’s (Domian et al., 2007), what types
of risks should be considered, (Cont, 2001; Goyal and Santa-Clara, 2003; Bali
et al., 2005), factors intrinsic to each stock (Fama and French, 1992; French
and Fama, 1993), the age of the investor, (Benzoni et al., 2007), and whether
international diversiﬁcation is beneﬁcial, (Jorion, 1985; Bai and Green, 2010),
among others.

Despite the recommendation of authorities like Domian et al. (2007), Bar-
ber and Odean (2008) reported that in a large sample of American private
investors the average portfolio size of individual stocks was only 4.3. While
comparable data does not appear to be available for private Chinese investors,
it seems unlikely that they hold substantially larger portfolios.

The mean returns and variances of the individual contributing stocks are
insuﬃcient for making an informed decision on selecting a suite of stocks
because selecting a portfolio requires an understanding of the correlations
between each of the stocks being considered for the portfolio. The number of
correlations between stocks rises in proportion to the square of the number of
stocks meaning that for all but the smallest of stock markets the very large
number of correlations is beyond the human ability to comprehend them.
Rea and Rea (2014) presented a method to visualise the correlation matrix
using neighbor-Net networks (Bryant and Moulton, 2004), yielding insights
into the relationships between the stocks.

Neighbor-Net networks are widely used in other ﬁelds, for example document
source critical analysis (Tehrani, 2013), understanding the cultural geogra-
phy of folktales (Ross et al., 2013), understanding human history through
language (Gray et al. (2010); Heggarty et al. (2010); Knooihuizen and Dediu
(2012) among others), understanding human history through housing tra-
ditions (Jordan and O’Neil, 2010) and to study the evolution of the skate-
board deck (Prentiss et al., 2011). Its main application area is biology where
neighbor-Net networks have appeared in hundreds of refereed papers. Re-
cently these networks have been used to assist in understanding cancer (see
Schwarz et al. (2015) for an example), investigate the evolution of high moun-
tain buttercups (Emadzade et al., 2015) and study mosquito borne viruses

(Bergqvist et al., 2015).

Traditional investing wisdom has suggested that investors should select in-
vestment opportunities from a range of industries because returns within
an industry would be more highly correlated than those between industries.
While that may hold true, there are some instances (such as companies with
operations in several industries) in which a stock exchange industry clas-
siﬁcation alone is insuﬃcient. Furthermore with some authors (including
Domian et al. (2007)) recommending over 100 investments, the number of
investments may exceed the number of industries meaning there is a need to
select a diverse range of stocks even within industries.

Another key aspect of stock correlation is the potential change in the corre-
lations with a signiﬁcant change in market conditions (say comparing times
of general market increase with recession and post-recession periods).

In this paper we explore investment opportunities in China using data from
the Shanghai Stock Exchange. We compare the correlation structure re-
ported in four periods (a period of market calm 2005/2006, a boom period
of 2006/2007, market decline (2008), and a post crash period 2009/2010).

Our primary motivation is to investigate four portfolio selection strategies.
The four strategies are;

1. picking stocks at random;

2. forming portfolios by picking stocks from diﬀerent industry groups;

3. forming portfolios by picking stocks from diﬀerent correlation clusters;

and

4. forming portfolios by picking stocks from industry groups within cor-

relation clusters.

Our results show that knowledge of correlations clusters can reduce the port-
folio risk.

The outline of this paper is as follows; Section (2) discusses the data, Section
(3) discusses the methods used in this paper, Section (4) discusses identi-
fying the correlation clusters, Section (5) discusses the movement of stocks
in the neighbor-Net splits graphs between study periods, Section (6) applies

3

the results of the previous two sections to the problem of forming a diver-
siﬁed portfolio of stocks, and Section (7) contains the discussion and our
conclusions.

2 Data

The data used in this study was downloaded from Datastream. We obtained
daily closing prices and dividend data for 126 stocks from the Shanghai A
Index. The data listed the stock name, a six digit identiﬁcation number,
and assigned the stock to one of ﬁve industry groups. These groups were (1)
Energy (12 stocks), (2) Finance (17 stocks), (3) Health Care (18 stocks), (4)
Industrial (33 stocks), and (5) Materials (36 stocks). To make the identiﬁ-
cation of the stocks and their exchange-assigned industry groups simpler we
generated four letter stock codes and to this code appended a single letter
indicating its industry group. A list of these can be found in Table (5) in A.
To estimate stock return correlations we calculated weekly returns from the
daily price and dividend data. To obtain the period returns we calculated
the total return for each period and treated the dividends as being reinvested
into the stock that issued them.

A graph of the index and the boundaries of our study periods can be found in
Figure (1). We deﬁned the study periods so that they represented as diﬀerent
market conditons as we could make them, though it could be argued that
our study periods one and four are similar.

Study period one was 13 May 2005 until 13 June 2006 and was a period in
which the market underwent a slow rise. Study period two was 13 June 2006
until 16 October 2007 and is a considered a boom or market bubble period.
Study period three was 16 October 2007 until 28 October 2008 representing
a sharp decline or crash. The ﬁnal study period was from 29 October 2008
until 19 October 2010 was a time of initial market recovery and then a largely
ﬂat returns.

With four study periods, for the portfolio selection methods which require
a model building, or estimation, period we can form models in periods one
through three and use the periods two through four for out-of-sample test-
ing. Such extremely diﬀerent market conditions represents a very severe test
of portfolio diversiﬁcation strategies, especially forming portfolios based on
period two and testing them against period three data.

3 Methods

3.1 Neighbor-Net Splits Graphs

A typical stock market correlation matrix for n stocks is of full rank which
means that it can only be represented fully in an (n − 1)-dimensional space.
Some basic statistics on the correlations are presented in Table (1). In vi-
sualization, the high dimensional data space is collapsed to a much lower
dimensional space so that the data can be represented on 2-dimensional sur-
face such as a page or computer screen.

sure which can be construed to be a distance.
In the literature the most
common way to do the conversion is by using the so-called ultra-metric,

(cid:113)

dij =

2(1 − ρij)

(1)

where dij is the estimated distance and ρij is the estimated correlation be-
tween stocks i and j, see Mantegna (1999) for details.

Using the conversion in Equation (1) we formatted the converted correlation
matrix and augmented it with the appropriate stock codes for reading into the
Neighbor-Net software, SplitsTree (Huson and Bryant, 2006), available from
http://www.splitstree.org. Using the SplitsTree software we generated
the Neighbor-Nets splits graphs. Because the splits graphs are intended
to be used for visualization we defer the discussion of the identiﬁcation of
correlation clusters and their uses to Sections (4) and (5) below.

3.2 Simulated Portfolios

Recently Lee (2011) discussed so-called risk-based asset allocation. In con-
trast to strategies which require both expected risk and expected returns
for each investment opportunity as inputs to the portfolio selection process,
risk-based allocation considers only expected risk. The four methods of port-
folio selection we present below can be considered to be risk-based allocation
methods. This probably reﬂects private investor behaviour in that often they
have nothing more than broker buy, hold, or sell recommendations to assess
likely returns.

The four portfolio methods were compared using simulations. For each of
1,000 iterations a portfolio was sampled based on the rules governing the
portfolio type. We recorded the mean and standard deviation of the returns
for the 1,000 portfolios.

As mentioned in the introduction the primary motivation is to investigate
four portfolio strategies. These are:

1. Selecting stocks at random;

2. Selecting stocks based on industry groupings;

3. Selecting stocks based on correlation clusters; and

6

4. Selecting stocks based on industry groups within correlation clusters.

We describe each of these in turn.

Random Selection: The stocks were selected at random using a uniform
distribution without replacement. In other words each stock was given
equal chance of being selected according but with no stock being se-
lected twice within a single portfolio.

By Industry Groups: There were ﬁve industry groups. If the portfolio
size was ﬁve or less, the industries were chosen at random using a
uniform distribution without replacement. From each of the selected
industry groups one stock was selected.
If the desired portfolio size
was more than ﬁve then each group had at least s stocks selected,
where s is the quotient of the portfolio size divided by ﬁve. Some (the
remainder of the portfolio size divided by ﬁve) industry groups will
have s + 1 stocks selected and the industry groups this applied to were
chosen using a uniform distribution without replacement. Within each
industry group stocks were selected using a uniform distribution, again
without replacement.

By Correlation Clusters: The correlation clusters were determined by
examining the Neighbor-Net network for the relevant periods (period
one, two and three). Each stock was assigned to exactly one cluster
and each cluster can be deﬁned by a single split (or bipartition) of
the circular ordering of the Neighbor-Net of the relevant period. The
clusters determined in periods one, two and three were used to generate
the portfolios for out-of-sample testing in periods two, three and four
respectively. Because the goal of portfolio building is to reduce risk
each cluster was paired with another cluster which was considered most
distant from it. This method is discussed in detail below.

As with the industry groups, if there were fewer clusters than the de-
sired portfolio size, cluster pairs were selected at random and a stock
selected from within each correlation cluster pair. If the desired portfo-
lio size was larger than the number of correlation cluster then we apply
the method described above for the industry clusters.

As indicated above each cluster was paired with the one most distant
from it. Because we identiﬁed an even number of clusters in period
two, cluster one was paired with cluster ﬁve, two with six and so on.
In periods with an odd number of clusters the pairing may not be so

7

straight-forward. For example, in period two (see Figure 2) we iden-
tiﬁed ﬁve clusters and cluster one was paired with four, both clusters
two and three were paired with ﬁve, four was paired with one and ﬁve
with two.

change for period two using ﬁve trading day returns to estimate correlations
and hence distances with the stocks in cluster one colour coded. The ﬁve
correlation clusters each have diﬀerent colours. In the discussion the clus-
ters are coded anti-clockwise as follows; Cluster 1 – Black, Cluster 2 – Blue,
Cluster 3 – Purple, Cluster 4 – Green, Cluster 5 – Red.

By Industry Group within Correlation Clusters: The ﬁnal method
was selecting stocks from industry groups within correlation clusters.
Each stock within each cluster has an associated industry group. There-
fore each correlation cluster can be subdivided into up to ﬁve sub-

As indicated above each cluster was paired with the one most distant
from it. Once a cluster was selected for inclusion, so was the paired
cluster, however this time we did not allow any of the paired stocks to
be from the same industry. This was the method used for determining
the set of stocks for the fourth portfolio strategy.

Identifying Correlation Clusters

As Bryant and Moulton (2004) point out “the splits graphs generated by
Neighbor-Net are always planar, an important advantage over other net-
work methods when it comes to visualization” (emphasis original). Thus one
method of identifying a group of stocks clustered by correlation is to exam-
ine the splits graph for the stocks (see, for example, Figure 3) and look for
natural breaks in the structure of the network.

The neighbor-Net splits graph is a type of map. All readers of a topographic
map read the map in the same way. The information they extract depends
on their needs. One person may read a map to extract information about
mountain ranges, another for information on river catchments, and still an-
other on the distribution of human settlements. But in all cases all map
readers agree which features are mountains, which are rivers and which are
towns and cities, no confusion arises because the map is read visually.

Because this is a visual approach, the information extracted from reading
a neighbor-Net splits graph depends on the researcher or ﬁnancial analyst
balancing whatever competing requirements they may have. Here we know
that in the simulations to follow the sizes of the portfolios we will generate
will be two, four, eight or 16 stocks. Consequently we do not need large num-
bers of clusters and we would like them to have a suﬃciently large number
of stocks that when selecting stocks at random from within the cluster that
there are a suﬃciently large number of combinations available to make the
simulations meaningful. These requirements guide us when identifying clus-
ters in the neighbor-Net splits graphs. The numbers of clusters and cluster
membership is determined visually and it is important not to confuse visual
with subjective. For period one we chose eight clusters, which was the maxi-
mum number of clusters in any period. The smallest cluster had nine stocks

(cid:1) = 36 distinct ways of choosing two stocks from this cluster in the

16 stock portfolio simulation.

Figure (3) shows the clusters we identiﬁed for period one. The stocks in
each cluster are listed in B.1. Cluster one is at the bottom in black and
the clusters are sequentially numbered moving counter-clockwise around the
splits graph. Cluster one can be recognised by the small, but clear, gaps in
the network structure between it and clusters two and eight. Similar small
gaps can be seen between the other clusters.

This grouping of eight clusters is not the only division of the stocks into
clusters which could have been made. If the researcher or ﬁnancial analyst
had other requirements some of the clusters could be further subdivided or
combined. For example if small clusters were acceptable then Cluster 2 could
be further split into two clusters, as could Cluster 8. In both cases there is a
clear gap in the network structure where the split could be made. Conversely,
if the number of clusters desired was reduced then there are some reasonably
clear combinations which could be made. For example, if only two clusters
were required, then, perhaps, Clusters 1, 2, 7, and 8 could be combined to
form one cluster while Clusters 3, 4, 5, and 6 would form the other.

5 Movements of Stocks in the Splits Graphs

between Periods

In Figures (4) through (11) we show the movement of industry groups both
within a cluster and between study periods. We compare this with the move-
ments of the materials industry group in the splits graph.

In Figure (4) we have selected Cluster 1 in study period 1 and assigned a
colour to each industry group within the cluster. While all ﬁve industry
groups are represented in the cluster it is clear that the materials group of
stocks represent the largest such group within this correlation cluster. Figures
(5) through (7) shows locations in the splits graph of the stocks from Cluster
1 of Period 1 in Periods 2 through 4. As can be seen the stocks in this initial
cluster do not remain clustered together in subsequent periods.

However, the materials group has remained together as a block not only in
study period two but also in study periods three and four. During period two
(Figure 5) the materials group from Cluster 1 is now in what we identiﬁed
as Cluster 3.
In study period three (Figure 6) they have split into two
groups and are in what we identiﬁed as Clusters 1 and 6, which are adjacent
clusters in that study period. Finally in study period four they are in what

10

we identiﬁed as Clusters 1 and 2, again, these are adjacent clusters in that
study period.

In diversiﬁcation one seeks groups of stocks which will tend to move together
in the future but relatively independently of other so-identiﬁed groups of
stocks. Then an investors spreads their investments across these groups.
This is the basis for previous studies which have grouped stocks by industry
assuming that stocks in the same industry will tend to have price movements
more similar than stocks in diﬀerent industries, see Section (5.1) below. Thus
the evidence presented here is that the stocks within Cluster one Period one
from the materials group form a ﬁnancially useful grouping when forming a
diversiﬁed portfolio for out-of-sample testing.

Because of this we would not expect portfolios selected from stocks within
correlation clusters alone to be signiﬁcantly less risky than those chosen from
industry groups. However, considering both a stock’s industry group and its
correlation cluster has potential to result in greater risk reduction than either
method on its own.

5.1 Clustering by Industry Group

In previous studies a number of authors have included in their studies of
forming diversiﬁed stock portfolios at least one method in which they dividied
the stocks into industry groups and then selected portfolios by spreading
the investments across the groups, see Domian et al. (2007) for example.
Neighbor-Nets splits graphs give us a direct method of assessing the likely
success of such a strategy. To illustrate this we have selected the energy
and materials groups because they had the smallest and largest number of
stocks, 12 and 36 respectively. Figures (8) through (11) show the locations
of the materials stocks. Similar diagrams for the other industry groups are
available from the authors on request.

Clustering of the materials stocks is clearly visible in each of the four study
periods. This gives a direct visual conﬁrmation of previous studies which have
reported that selecting stocks by spreading them across industry groups gives
a greater reduction in portfolio risk than randomly selecting stocks.

6 Example

This examples uses 126 stocks from the Shanghai exchange, for which we
calculated the weekly returns from price and dividend data and we divided
the data into four periods based on market behaviour as discussed in Section
(2) above. Some basic statistics on the correlations are presented in Table
(1). As can be seen the highest average correlation occurred in period 3, a
time of a sharp market decline or crash.

For all the periods, as the portfolio size was increased the standard deviation
of the returns decreased across all four portfolio selection methods. Early
empirical studies of portfolio diversiﬁcation focused on the number of stocks
in a portfolio, see Evans and Archer (1968). A larger portfolio was reported
to be less risky with the lower risk being a result of the lower level of variation
in the returns. However, the beneﬁt of reduced risk rapidly diminished with
increasing portfolio size.

An ANOVA test was used to compare the means, because the variances were
within a small range the ANOVA test remains valid even though the Levene
test detects statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences. The Levene test was applied
using the lawstat package in R (Gastwirth et al., 2013).

125)/2 = 7875 correlations between the 126 stocks. The ﬁnal column gives
the count of the number of correlations which were estimated to be negative.
The highest proportion of negative correlations occurred in period 2 when
approximately 6% of estimated correlations were negative.

Period two was a period of general market increase and the returns were good
during this period. Table (2) presents the mean and standard deviations of
returns together with some statistical testing of the results. The returns
were statistically signiﬁcantly diﬀerent for portfolios of size 16 and weakly
signiﬁcant for portfolios of size 2. For the smallest portfolios the correlation
cluster method performed best and for portfolios of size 4 and 16 the industry
and correlation clusters method performed best.

Table 2: Returns in percent under the four diﬀerent portfolio selection meth-
ods for period two using period one data for the estimation of the correlations.
Underneath each set of returns, in brackets, is the standard deviation of the
returns. The ﬁnal column reports the p-value of the ANOVA analysis which
tests for diﬀerences in the means or the Levene test which tests whether the
standard deviations of all four methods are equal as appropriate for each line.

For all the portfolios the variation in the returns decreased as the portfolio
size increased. The Levene test showed that there was statistically signiﬁcant
diﬀerences in the standard deviations for portfolios of size 4, 8 and 16. For
portfolios of size 4 and 8 the correlation cluster method produced the lowest
variation in the returns. For portfolios of size 16 it was the industry and cor-
relation cluster method that produces the lowest variation, by a substantial
margin.

Table (3) presents the mean and standard deviations of returns together with
some statistical testing of the results for period three. This was a period
of general market decline. In these circumstances a widely used risk/return
measure such as the Sharpe ratio is negative. In such circumstances a private
investor would regard a portfolio which minimised the losses as be the most
desirable. While we should not over interpret the results, the correlation
clusters have slightly better returns for portfolios of sizes 2, 4 and 8. The
industry and correlation clusters and industry based groupings have slightly
better returns for portfolios of size 16.

As with period two out of sample testing, the variation decreased as the port-
folio size was increased, regardless of the method used to select the portfolio.
The Levene test showed that there was statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerences
in the variances in the standard deviations for portfolios of size 4, 8, and

16. Typically the correlation cluster method showed the largest standard
deviations and random selection method the lowest standard deviations. For
portfolios of size 16 the industry and correlation clusters method reported
the smallest variation.

Table (4) presents the mean and standard deviations of returns together with
some statistical testing of the results for period four. This period showed
modest returns. While, again, we should not over-interpret the results, the
returns were lower for random and industry grouping selection methods for
all four portfolios sizes tested. The highest returns were for the correla-
tion clusters portfolio selection method for the two smaller portfolios, and
for portfolios of size 8 and 16 the industry and correlation clusters method
reports slightly higher returns.

As with period two and three out of sample testing, the variation decreased
as the portfolio size was increased, regardless of the method used to select
the portfolio. The Levene test showed that there was statistically signiﬁcant
diﬀerences in the variances for the portfolios of sizes 4, 8 and 16. The industry
based selection method oﬀered the greatest reduction in the variation in the
returns for portfolios of size 4 and 8. For the largest portfolio size (portfolios
of size 16) the industry and correlation clusters had the lowest standard
deviations (the same outcome as periods two and three).

Table 4: Returns in percent under the four diﬀerent portfolio selection meth-
ods for period four using period three data for the estimation of the correla-
tions. Underneath each set of returns, in brackets, is the standard deviation
of the returns. The ﬁnal column reports the p-value of the ANOVA anal-
ysis which tests for diﬀerences in the means or the Levene test which tests
whether the standard deviations of all four methods are equal as appropriate.

Therefore this suggests that the correlation clusters (or industry and corre-
lation clusters) are particularly eﬀective in times of general market increase,
with the beneﬁt being either a reduction in the variation or an increase in
the return.

This study shows that combining industry and correlation clusters is par-
ticularly eﬀective at lowering the variation for the larger portfolios, with all
three periods showing a much lower variation for portfolios of size 16, as well
as reasonable returns. This is in line with general advice to investors to hold
larger portfolios and to ensure the holdings are diversiﬁed.

7 Discussion

An earlier paper (Rea and Rea, 2014) introduced Neighbor-Net networks as
a method for visualising correlations in stock markets. The method has the
advantage of being able to represent a lot of the key features of the correlation
matrix in a planar graphic. The paper noted that such a diagram could
assist with creating diversiﬁed portfolios. This paper has highlighted the
eﬀectiveness of using correlation clusters to investigate diversiﬁed portfolios.

15

In this paper four risk budgeting methods of portfolio selection were com-
pared; randomly selected portfolios, industry clusters, correlation clusters
and industry and correlation clusters. Traditionally selecting stocks by in-
dustry was considered an appropriate method to diversify a portfolio. While
this may be the case in some markets and under some market conditions, this
investigation demonstrated that industry based clusters was generally out-
performed by portfolios selected at random, however the portfolios selected
using industry grouping may have lower variance in times of market increase
compared with random selection.

Of the four, the most restrictive method of selecting portfolios was the in-
dustry and correlation cluster selection method. With the random selection
method all possible combinations of n stocks from the 126 stocks are allow-
able but for the industry and correlation cluster selection method, there are
many portfolios that are not admissible because they do not meet the rules of
this portfolio selection method. The industry grouping and correlation clus-
ter methods are also restrictive but less so than the industry and correlation
clusters method.

The main concern was whether the rules of portfolio selection presented here
oﬀer signiﬁcant beneﬁts.
If a diﬀerence in mean was detected, the corre-
lation clusters or industry and correlation clusters method may outperform
the other methods on mean return. This eﬀect was most pronounced in the
period four out of sample testing where the returns for the correlations clus-
ters and industry and correlation clusters method always exceeded random
portfolio selection. Therefore the knowledge of the circular ordering can be
used to enhance portfolio returns.

The variation in the returns for portfolios of size 16 was always lowest if the
method of portfolio selection was Industry and Correlation Cluster selection.
For the other portfolio sizes the variation with a method decreases as the
portfolio size increases, but no one method consistently outperforms the oth-
ers. This suggests portfolio size has a greater impact on the variation of the
returns than the method used to select of the portfolio.

Rea and Rea (2014) discussed how stocks from the opposite side of the
Neighbor-Net network did not necessarily create a portfolio with high re-
turns because some stocks maybe giving negative returns while one on the
opposite side of the network may be giving positive returns. Dividing the
data into four periods in the manner we did, represents a particularly severe
test of diversiﬁcation, particularly since no account was taken of either his-
torical or expected returns of the stocks. It is our expectation that investor

16

knowledge and analysis alongside correlation cluster based portfolio selection
has the potential to improve the return of the portfolio, as well as reduce the
variance (or equivalently, the standard deviation). But this awaits further
research.

We note that the correlation clusters were determined by eye in this analysis.
This is a valid method of determining clusters, exploiting both the structure
of the network and the circular ordering of stocks the neighbor-Net algorithm
produces. Future work could focus on methods to automate the selection of
the correlation clusters to see if this further enhances the portfolio perfor-
mance.
