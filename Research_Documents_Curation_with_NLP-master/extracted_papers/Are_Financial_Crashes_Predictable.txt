Abstract

We critically review recent claims that ﬁnancial crashes can be pre-
dicted using the idea of log-periodic oscillations or by other methods in-
spired by the physics of critical phenomena.
In particular, the October
1997 ‘correction’ does not appear to be the accumulation point of a geo-
metric series of local minima.

It is rather tempting to see ﬁnancial crashes as the analogue of critical
points in statistical mechanics, where the response to a small external per-
turbation becomes inﬁnite, because all the subparts of the system respond
cooperatively (a large proportion of the actors in a market decide simulta-
neously to sell their stocks). If one furthermore assumes that ‘log-periodic’
corrections (for which there is a recent upsurge of interest [1]) are present,
then one can try to use the oscillations seen on markets as precursors to
predict the crash time tc, which is the point where these oscillations ac-
cumulate. Intriguing hints supporting this scenario have been reported in
[2, 3], and more recently in [4, 5], where it was even claimed that the Oc-
tober 1997 correction could be predicted (see also [6]). As a proof of this,
the implementation of a winning strategy was reported in [7]. In view of
the considerable echo that these claims have enjoyed, in particular in the

1

physics community [8], we feel that it is important to temper the growing
enthusiasm by discussing a few facts.

In general, the unveiling of a new phenomenon either results from a
strong theoretical argument suggesting its existence, or from compelling
experimental evidence. In the present case, there is no convincing theo-
retical model which substantiates the idea that crashes are critical points
– not even speaking about log-periodic oscillations. On the ‘experimental’
side, there has been only very few crashes where this scenario (or any the-
oretical model for that matter) can be tested. Hence, although suggestive,
the empirical ﬁndings are obviously not statistically signiﬁcant. The fact
of correctly predicting one event ex ante (the October 1997 correction [7])
is clearly not enough to prove the theory right: many ‘chartists’ make a
living by ‘recognizing’ patterns on past charts of prices and are on av-
erage right 50% of the time. We want to publicly disclose here the fact
that on the basis of a log-periodic analysis, a crash on the JGB (Japanese
Government Bonds) for the end of May, 1995 was predicted [9]. On this
basis, one of us (JPA) bought for $1,000,000 of put options in early May
1995, a sum representing less than 1% of the amount under management
of CFM (a fund management company trading on the basis of statistical
models). The crash did not occur, and only a delicate trading back allowed
to avoid losses. The point is not that the out-of-sample prediction failed
(the risk was deliberately taken), but rather that it worked one time and
failed the other, a fact that is not mentioned in [7]. Obviously, this does
not mean that the method works 50% of the time (which would already
be quite interesting); an apparent success out of a least two trials is just
not statistically signiﬁcant!

The methodological procedure used to extract the ‘crash time’ tc is
actually rather dubious, since a seven (or even nine) parameters ﬁt to
noisy data is required, which is of some concern. Sometimes, the time
period over which the ﬁt is performed is rather long, which implies that a
small dip occuring more than ﬁve years before the crash must be seen as
causally related to the crash, which is somehow hard to believe. A more
robust prediction of the log-periodic scenario is that the price chart should
exhibit a sequence of minima (and maxima) at times tn such that:

tn+1 − tn
tn − tn−1

= λ

tn − tn−1
tn−1 − tn−2

λ < 1

(1)

i.e. that the time lags between minima follows a geometric contraction.
The crash time is deﬁned as the accumulation of these minima. Looking
at the S&P chart between 1994 and the end of 1997 (see ﬁgure 1), one can
identify ﬁve ‘major’ minima, most of them being identiﬁed as such by the
press at the time, the last (at time t5) one being the October 1997 ‘crash’
[10]. (Of course, there are also many local minima of less importance).
One ﬁnds the following time lags (in days): t2 − t1 = 403, t3 − t2 = 182,
t4 − t3 = 97 and t5 − t4 = 44. On the basis of the four ﬁrst events, one
obtains three time lags and thus two estimates of λ, namely 0.45 and 0.53,

from which one estimates t5 − t4 = 48 ± 4: this is the ‘crash’ prediction,
which indeed worked well since the observed t5 − t4 = 44 [11]. But, the
scenario also predicts that another drawdown should have occurred at t6
such that t6−t5 ≃ 20, i.e, at the end of November 1997, and maybe another
one 9 days later – none of which occurred. One can of course argue that the
accumulation of crash times will be smeared out when one reaches the day
(or the week) time scale, but in any case a 6th minimum should have been
observed, otherwise the very notion of ‘critical point’ is empty. In view
of the fact that three successive ratios λ were close to one another (and
close to their 1987 value [12]), the possibility of a crash occuring at the end
of November was real; conversely, its non existence throws serious doubts
on the validity of a log-periodic scenario. Furthermore, one can study
the Hong-Kong index which did experience a serious crash at the end of
November 1997. One ﬁnds that the above tn, n = 1, 5 indeed corresponds
to rather deep minima; however, there are also at least two extra ‘obvious’
minimum between t1 and t2 which ruins the idea of a constant λ (see ﬁgure
1).

Using somewhat related ideas, another prediction of the October 1997
correction was reported in [6]. These authors also predicted a 13% fall
of the S&P during March 1998 [13], which did not occur (the index rose
by 5% instead). We have systematically tested their method, where the
price at the end of the next month is predicted on the basis of the previous

three to ﬁve months. We studied the S&P from 1990 to the beginning of
1998, and found that, for example, the prediction error using the 3 point
procedure described in [6] is about 10% (see table 1), which is three times
larger than the simplest ‘no-change’ prediction, i.e. that next month price
is equal to this month price!

To answer the question raised in the title, we have argued that the
recent claims on the predictability of crashes are at this point not trust-
worthy. This however does not mean that crash precursors do not exist, an
example could be a systematic increase of the volatility prior to the crash.
This general subject certainly merits further investigations. Finance is a
fascinating ﬁeld with huge amounts of money at stake. There is a danger
that this might sometimes lead physicists astray from minimal scientiﬁc
rigor.

assumption that option prices are not too far from ‘fair-game’, this
means that the market estimated the probability of such an adverse
move to be about 20%.

since the S&P index made a strong rebound on the following day and
reached a new historical high about a month later!

[11] The t4 occured in August 1997. With this information in hand, we
(and others, for example [5], or I. Kogan in Oxford (private commu-
nication)) also calculated t5 to be around the end of October 1997.
However, we judged the evidence too thin to take the bet. Obviously,
this was a missed opportunity; but it shows that the evidence was
simply not compelling.

[12] Note that the parameter λ for the 1987 crash is calculated using the
7 (or 9) parameter ﬁt to a full log-periodic oscillating function, while
for the 1997 crash, identiﬁcation of the local minima is used. Neither
method works convincingly in the other case.
