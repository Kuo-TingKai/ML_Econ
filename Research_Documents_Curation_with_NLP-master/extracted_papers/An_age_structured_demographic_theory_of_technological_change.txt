Abstract

At the heart of technology transitions lie complex processes of social and industrial dynamics. The quantitative
study of sustainability transitions requires modelling work, which necessitates a theory of technology substitution.
Many, if not most, contemporary modelling approaches for future technology pathways overlook most aspects of
transitions theory, for instance dimensions of heterogenous investor choices, dynamic rates of diﬀusion and the pro-
ﬁle of transitions. A signiﬁcant body of literature however exists that demonstrates how transitions follow S-shaped
diﬀusion curves or Lotka-Volterra systems of equations. This framework is used ex-post since timescales can only be
reliably obtained in cases where the transitions have already occurred, precluding its use for studying cases of interest
where nascent innovations in protective niches await favourable conditions for their diﬀusion. In principle, scaling
parameters of transitions can, however, be derived from knowledge of industrial dynamics, technology turnover rates
and technology characteristics. In this context, this paper presents a theory framework for evaluating the parameteri-
sation of S-shaped diﬀusion curves for use in simulation models of technology transitions without the involvement of
historical data ﬁtting, making use of standard demography theory applied to technology at the unit level. The classic
Lotka-Volterra competition system emerges from ﬁrst principles from demography theory, its timescales explained in
terms of technology lifetimes and industrial dynamics. The theory is placed in the context of the multi-level perspec-
tive on technology transitions, where innovation and the diﬀusion of new socio-technical regimes take a prominent
place, as well as discrete choice theory, the primary theoretical framework for introducing agent diversity.

1. Introduction

Socio-technical regime transitions are notoriously complex to model and understand quantitatively, but such an
understanding may be crucial for anticipating and informing the planning of sustainability transitions. Socio-technical
systems play important societal functions (Geels, 2002, 2005), and these services and their demand are in a continuous
evolution. Meanwhile, the evolution of technology generates unforeseen opportunities to society that enable the
creation of activities that did not exist previously, producing a complex interaction between technology, society and the
economy, generating economic development through Schumpeter’s widely discussed but not well understood process
of ‘Creative Destruction’ (Schumpeter 1934, 1939, 1942; see also Nelson and Winter 1982). Technological change
occurs through a gradual process of technology substitutions which stems from a continuous stream of decision-
making performed by a myriad of actors involved in the operation of technology or the consumption of the services
it generates (Gr¨ubler, 1998, Gr¨ubler et al., 1999). This spans from the power sector, transport, communications and
information technologies, to heating, cooling and lighting equipment and so on. In other words, technological change
occurs in sectors performing societal functions where generation technologies or socio-technical regimes are not
unique and competition occurs. Change in such sectors occurs through the choices of consumers or investors facing
various alternatives and incomplete information, and these decisions are based, in a context of bounded rationality,
on diverse sets of considerations and constraints (Nelson and Winter, 1982).

The process of technological change is not currently well described by any generally accepted theory.1 However,
a signiﬁcant and well known body of empirical literature exists that consistently describes the process of technology
substitutions through gradual S -shaped curves (e.g. Fisher and Pry 1971, Mansﬁeld 1961, Wilson 2009; see reviews
by Gr¨ubler 1998, Gr¨ubler et al. 1999). As opposed to neoclassical technology vintage theory where capital vintages
have optimal lifetimes and are treated with a reversible equilibrium theory (i.e. not path-dependent, Boucekkine et al.
(2004), Johansen (1959), Solow et al. (1966), for a review see Boucekkine et al. (2011)), S -shaped curves suggest to
adopt an approach where time and complex dynamics take a prominent role (e.g. the contagion model of Mansﬁeld
(1961)). As we show here, attractive parallels with mathematical theories of population dynamics in biology, grounded
in the understanding of the processes of birth and death of biological individuals (humans, animals, cells, etc), are
more than simple analogies (e.g. Metcalfe, 2004, Silverberg, 1988).

The best known such parallel is to use the Lotka-Volterra system of population growth equations of competing
species in ecosystems for the competition of technologies in markets (for an explanation and history see Andersen,
1994), or equivalently, the replicator dynamics equation of evolutionary game theory (Hofbauer and Sigmund, 1998)
applied to social sciences. While this idea has strong support in the ﬁeld of evolutionary economics (Safarzynska and van den Bergh,
2010, Saviotti and Mani, 1995), it also makes intuitive sense to perceive competing technologies (or even socio-
technical systems) in the marketplace similarly to competing species in ecosystems (or even competing sub-ecosystems
and food chains). The parallel has been brought further with the development of evolutionary game theory (for a re-
view, see Hodgson and Huang 2012), the pioneers of which were acutely aware of the strong analogy that could be
drawn between the mathematics of the evolution of genotype frequencies and their selection in a population in biol-
ogy, and the process of innovation and technology diﬀusion in economics. In addition to providing a deﬁnition to
the concept of bounded rationality, this strand of literature demonstrates that the parallel, although described with yet
insuﬃcient precision, is more than just intuitive (Metcalfe, 2008, 2004). As we show here, the missing link lies in the
realm of technology selection and demography.

The description of technological change or technology evolution following parallels with biology currently re-
mains in the conceptual and theoretical domain (for a review, see Safarzynska and van den Bergh, 2010) or in stylised
form (e.g. ‘history-friendly models’ of Malerba et al. 1999; recombinant models of Safarzynska and van den Bergh
2012; or the replicator dynamics of Saviotti and Mani (1995)). They are not quite adapted to actual quantitative appli-
cations such as modelling the supply of particular goods or services, technology mixes or the economic and environ-
mental impacts that these may have. Meanwhile, Geels (2002), using the multi-level perspective, describes the diﬀu-
sion of socio-technical systems as much more complex than simple substitution events represented by a set of coupled
diﬀerential equations, involving niches, early uncoordinated innovations and transformations in the social context,
seemingly precluding any modelling attempts at all. Despite this, it is remarkable that diﬀusion processes have been
observed in a myriad of contexts to follow a very simple ordering principle,2 logistic curves or the more general Lotka-
Volterra system of equations (Farrell, 1993, Fisher and Pry, 1971, Lakka et al., 2013, Marchetti and Nakicenovic,
1978, Nakicenovic, 1986, Sharif and Kabir, 1976, Wilson, 2009, 2012, and many more), and that such simple pat-
terns emerge from the underlying complexity.

In order to maintain a quantitative perspective in a computational model, the analysis can be restricted to the
selection and diﬀusion component. As opposed to a fully evolutionary theory, this excludes the early erratic innovation
process, assuming that new but established technologies permeate the landscape in dormant niches that could wake up,
diﬀuse and potentially dominate given the right selection environment, for instance with targeted policy. From then
onwards, the diﬀusion process, gaining momentum, becomes ﬁrmer and simpler to project quantitatively. Although
the quantitative prediction of technology diﬀusion is inherently highly uncertain, in parts due to the actual evolutionary
nature of technological change, it is nevertheless a highly worthwhile venture to undertake, particularly for instance in
the climate change mitigation context, in which the description of technological change is crucial in order to project
energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and their related environmental impacts (e.g. in power generation,
transport, industry). As we show elsewhere (Mercure et al., 2014), this approach oﬀers a signiﬁcant improvement

over current optimisation approaches where technological change has no clear theoretical underpinning.

While concepts of technology diﬀusion provide insights on the key dynamics involved in transitions, they have
not been used signiﬁcantly in the modelling literature beyond the ex-post empirical description of past data, using
the observed pattern, the logistic curve (Fisher and Pry, 1971, Marchetti and Nakicenovic, 1978, Nakicenovic, 1986,
Sharif and Kabir, 1976, Wilson, 2009, 2012, and many more). Despite the fact that innovation may be the primary
driver of economic growth (Nelson and Winter, 1982, Schumpeter, 1934, 1939), the process of technology diﬀu-
sion has yet to be even considered in large scale mainstream models such as those for energy systems modelling
and related energy policy analysis. These predominantly use representative agent cost-optimisation algorithms (e.g.
TIMES/MARKAL, IEA/ETSAP, 2012) as a descriptive mechanism, which has no theoretical or empirical ground-
ing.3 Indeed, this current lack of a representation of empirical dynamics is partly due to the fact that, while empirical
diﬀusion measurements suggest a system for forecasting technology or market evolution, such projections would rely
on measured time scaling parameters, which can be reliably measured only precisely in cases of older technologies
where transitions have already occurred. Eﬀectively, by the non-linear nature of the problem itself, obtaining such
time scaling parameters for new technologies for which forecasting would be critically important cannot be reliably
done based on the small amounts of available data.4

I thus ask the question, is it possible to use empirically known technology dynamics to forecast technology? If so,
how can it be parameterised? As argued above, important scientiﬁc gains could be generated if new insight could be
found on how to obtain these parameters through other means than the empirical ﬁtting of diﬀusion data, requiring
to establish a quantitative theory to understand their nature. These parameters are timescales, and this suggests
that their meaning is associated to the use, the building and the scrapping of technology in time at the unit level,
hinting to the use of demography theory applied to technology. Previous work has shown that the use of the Lotka-
Volterra equation system can be made convenient, even mainstreamed, with the creation of the ‘Future Technology
Transformations’ family of computational models (Mercure, 2012), which enables to explore the impact and dynamics
of policy instruments on choices of diverse agents, with real-world data. This model is based on the theory presented
here. It was recently used to evaluate climate change impacts of combinations of policy instruments in 21 countries
covering the World by integrating it to macroeconometric and climate modelling frameworks (Mercure et al., 2014),
and currenlty runs under a resolution of 54 countries and 24 technologies (Cambridge Econometrics, 2014).

The goal of this paper is thus to derive a parameterisation method from a detailed theory. I ﬁrst frame the problem
by using an example of empirical data, and place it in context within its appropriate theoretical framework, transitions
theory (section 2). Second, I derive from ﬁrst principles components of a quantitative theory of technological change,
based on survival (or demographic) analysis explaining the origin of the timescales of change (section 3). Third, by
invoking theoretical concepts of technology choice mostly based on discrete choice theory, I combine the components
to demonstrate how a Lotka-Volterra system (or replicator dynamics) can be derived from demography theory from
ﬁrst principles (section 4). Finally, I interpret this theory by demonstrating the origin of the the scaling parameters
of the Lotka-Volterra system, and point to how these can be used in real models of technology that could potentially
replace with reasonable ease incumbent cost-optimisation models (section 5).

2. Framing the problem and putting it into theoretical context

2.1. The Lotka-Volterra equation for empirical technology transitions

The parallel between technology and biology/ecology can be summarised as follows. Figure 1 presents the iconic
data from Nakicenovic (1986) for the transition between horse-drawn carriages and petrol cars that occurred in the
1920s. In this data, a transition is observed superimposed onto an exponential growth in the number of vehicles.
Through closer inspection, one observes that by dividing the numbers of horses and cars by the total number of
transport units, functions reminiscent of logistic curves are observed that cross each other in around 1915 (using S

3No evidence points to cost-optimisation behaviour by agents, i.e. ﬁrms (Nelson and Winter, 1982) or consumers (Douglas and Isherwood,
1979), including at an aggregate level (Keen, 2011), and no theory satisfactorily proves that an ‘average’ representative agent can correctly repro-
duce the aggregate behaviour of an underlying diverse set of agents, including neoclassical theory (Keen, 2011).

4E.g. ﬁtting logistic curves requires data that spans at least beyond the inﬂexion point.

This is shown to be an accurate assessment by displaying the fractional data as S /(1 − S ) on semilog axes, generating
linear trends, of which the time scaling parameters α are obtained from the slope:

1 − S 1! = α12(t − t0),

log  S 2

1 − S 2! = α21(t − t0), α12 = −α21,

Taking a time derivative of these expressions, one obtains a pair of diﬀerential equations fully describing the system:

= α12S 1(cid:0)1 − S 1(cid:1) = α12S 1S 2,

This example depicts the interaction occurring within a pair of technologies. Geels (2005) criticises the analysis
of Nakicenovic (1986) by invoking the presence of two other important transport technologies that have interacted
with and inﬂuenced the development of petrol vehicles but have not pervaded the market, namely electric trams and
bicycles. Eﬀectively, in most cases of technology competition, it is nearly impossible to exclude the existence of a
third interacting component, and a fourth and so on,5

generalising the theory to an arbitrary number n of technologies interacting in the marketplace, with interaction
time constants held in the antisymmetric matrix αi j.
It corresponds to the so-called replicator dynamics used in
evolutionary game theory (imitation dynamics, Hofbauer and Sigmund, 1998, p86) and evolutionary economics
(Safarzynska and van den Bergh, 2010), in binary interaction form. A more common version however is one of com-
parison of the ﬁtness of a candidate to the average ﬁtness of the population,

Here, the ﬁrst term riNi is the birth of individuals with birth rates ri, generating an exponential growth component,
and the second term, negative, expresses both the interference of a specie with itself, when resources become scarce
and individuals begin to compete, or the interference across species6 competing for the same resources. The new
parameter Ntot is the carrying capacity of the ecosystem, the number of individuals that the system can accommodate.
In the technology context, the carrying capacity corresponds to the total number of units of technology supplying the
demand for a service, or societal function, following a demand led economic assumption. In this analysis, however,
the parameters ri and αi j contain lots of information and thus need unpacking, which we proceed to do below.

2.2. Combining technology demography and choice modelling

This paper presents a model of technological change that explains the pattern given above, deriving from ﬁrst
principles a replicator dynamics equation for technologies at the unit level from demography theory,7 and provides
meaning to its parameters (αi j) in terms of information that relates to technology and industry characteristics (e.g.
life expectancy, rates of capital investments, etc). Several independent strands of demography exist, using either a
continuous or a discrete form, (all equivalent, Keyﬁtz, 1977), of which I shall choose the continuous form. Human
demography in the continuous version corresponds to an age structured form of single specie population dynamics.
It provides an in-depth view of the process of population evolution through age speciﬁc stochastic birth and death
events, using probabilities of giving birth and of dying for age tranches covering a whole lifetime. This provides
demographers with a ﬁner accuracy for population projections than crude average birth and death rates. This is also
partly equivalent to survival analysis as used in engineering to determine the statistics of failure of devices. A system
of competing species can also be described with an age structure. I create here such a construction for technology
dynamics, which, as I will show, explains the form of the technological change process due to its key property of
self-correlation in time.

In contrast to demography, however, the birth of technology obviously does not occur through pregnancy, although
it is possible to deﬁne an equivalent birth function (or maternity function, see Kot, 2001). Technology birth takes
place in an industrial structure through the investment of ﬁnanciers in production capital and labour, using for this
the proﬁts on sale of these same technologies. Sales are the process by which population expansions can take place:
if sales increase, the production capital and labour can be expanded, but if sales decrease, the production capital and
labour must eventually depreciate due to lack of investment. In order to explore this I thus proceed in section 3 with
describing mathematically the birth, death and the nature of competition in a market.

The choice of technology however is a human process, and the human population is naturally diverse. To model
choice by diverse agents, a standard theory exists which is commonly applied, discrete choice theory (e.g. voter
models, transport mode choice, see Ben-Akiva and Lerman, 1985, McFadden, 1973). This is also known as logit
models, in which the choice probability commonly takes the form
eUi

fi =

fi =

eUi + eU j

6The relative signs of the elements in αi j when permuting i and j determine the nature of the interaction, i.e. competition or predator-prey.
7E.g. how long does a car survive for on roads? How many cars of a particular type can be produced in a year?

where Ui is the so-called random (i.e. stochastic) utility associated to each choice. These models however, if applied as
they are to technological change, fundamentally assume perfect information and technology access by diverse agents,
and, without further dynamics, instantaneous diﬀusion. It however appears appropriate to connect discrete choice
theory with the replicator equation of evolutionary game theory. As we show below, a duality exists between the
binary interaction form of the Lotka-Volterra (eq. 6) and the multi-technology form of the common replicator equation
of evolutionary theory (eq. 5), and furthermore, the multinomial logit approximately emerges when transforming the
Lotka-Volterra system in to this form of the replicator equation (section 4.4).

2.3. The multi-level perspective in transitions theory

This work can be brought into the perspective of transitions theory, the main qualitative theoretical framework
to describe transitions of socio-technical regimes. This paper however treats the problem from a multi-technology
competition perspective, which can thus be brought into the transitions theory context.

Starting from the picture of Geels (2002), the process of technology transitions from a multi-technology com-
petition perspective can be thought of as going through two diﬀerent phases. This is depicted in ﬁgure 2. New
technologies originate from small, erratic, cumulative incremental innovations that gradually gain coordination as in-
ventors and ﬁrms get to grips with understanding their own market and ﬁguring out what is possible technically. This
is shown with small randomly oriented arrows, with three colours indicating three innovations generating roughly the
same service, or societal function. Many trials and errors generate experience and learning that gradually determine
the successful direction to take. Once this happens, better deﬁned technologies in a particular socio-technical context
begin to gain momentum of diﬀusion, and enter what I will call the demographic phase. At this point, the growth rate
is determined both by: (1) agent choices (in terms of the respective advantages and ﬂaws of competing technologies
including the incumbent) within the socio-technical context and its evolution, (2) the timescales of birth and death, or
technology turnover. In a situation of very clear and favourable consumer preferences and socio-technical evolution,
the diﬀusion becomes limited by the birth rate of the new technology, and by the death rate of the old technology
being replaced: the timescales of technological change which are the subject of this paper.

The innovation phase is diﬃcult to model in a forecasting context, as this would require knowing the unknown,
innovations that have not yet been developed, inventions that have not yet been invented. Therefore, it is diﬃcult to
describe the emergence of new technologies beyond the qualitative picture by Geels (2002). However, the impacts
of innovation on prices is simple to include using learning curves, if they are known. When technologies enter the
demographic phase, they are well deﬁned with a dominant design, and modelling their diﬀusion becomes straightfor-
ward, given a model of technology choices and knowledge of their survival properties, the birth and survival functions
deﬁned below, or equivalently the life expectancy and the rate of reinvestment into production capital and labour of
all competing technologies. This diﬀusion is thus made uncertain in such a model in parts by the lack of possibility
of emergence of disruptive alternatives.

3. Model components: birth, death and choice of technology

3.1. The death process

The death of technology at the unit level can occur in diﬀerent ways with diﬀerent probabilities. For example, in
the transport sector, vehicles can be retired due to fatal accidents, failures, or by economic decisions of owners due
to increasing costs of maintenance with age.8 These processes have diﬀerent probabilities of occurring as functions
of vehicle age. For a technology of brand-model i, taking the probability of destruction at age a as pi(a)∆a, and the
number ni(a, t′)∆t′ of technology units produced between year t′ and t′ + ∆t′ (or age interval ∆a),9 the change in this
age distribution of technology units ∆n(a, t) at time t during an ageing interval ∆a due to destructions is

∆ni(a, t′)∆t′ = −pi(a)ni(a, t′)∆t′∆a.

(8)

8The existence of sunk costs, investments in exchange for which technology is expected to operate for a certain amount of time, imply the
existence of a non-zero life expectancy. This is particularly true if money is borrowed for the purchase of a unit and repaid during its operating
lifetime.

9E.g. the number of 2003 Citroen C3 currently 11 years old.

6

Figure 2: Illustration of the demographic phase of technology transitions, adapted from Geels (2002). Small arrows represent small incremental
erratic innovations, during the innovation phase, which gradually gain coordination and momentum before diﬀusion takes place, entering the
demographic phase. One technology is in decline (gray), disappearing at a maximum rate related to its survival function ℓ(a). One technology
initially gains market shares at the expense of the one declining (blue), but is in time beaten in the race by another (black), which in turn is overtaken
by yet another technology (red). The maximum growth rate is related to the birth function m(b). The socio-technical context, consumer preferences
and the environment generate selection mechanisms driving market share exchanges between technologies.

In the continuous limit (∆a → 0), solving this for a yields

ni(a, t′)∆t′ = ni(0, t′)ℓi(a)∆t′,

ℓi(a) = exp −Z a

0

pi(a′)da′! .

(9)

ℓi(a) is the common demographic survival function, while pi(a) is the instantaneous force of death (see for instance
Keyﬁtz, 1977). This is depicted in ﬁg. 3 (left panel). When used in relation to people, survival functions are derived
from life tables where individuals are traced during their lifetime from birth until death, which, when applied to
technology, is called survival analysis in engineering. The various processes of technology death can be associated to
components in ℓi(a). Accidents normally have a constant force of death, and therefore give ℓi(a) a simple exponential
form. Meanwhile, scrapping due to failures tend to occur later during technology life, with increasing values of p(a).
Thus ℓ(a) can be written as

p(a) =

each term corresponding to diﬀerent destruction processes with diﬀerent timescales τn. If accidents dominate the
destruction process, then ℓi(a) should take predominantly an exponential form, while if the probability of failures
dominates and increases approximately linearly with age, ℓi(a) takes the form of a gaussian, and so on. The survival
of transport vehicles in the USA was shown to follow approximately a mixture of τ1 and τ2 processes (ORNL, 2012,
and references therein). While ℓi(a) expresses the probability of a technology unit to remain in use until age a, the
negative of its derivative expresses the probability of destruction at age a. The life expectancy τi is deﬁned as

where for each age tranche between a and ∆a (or production year between t′ and t′ + ∆t′), the number of deaths
depend on the probability of destruction times the number of units of that age remaining, which decreases every year.
The number of units in each age tranche originates from sales that happened a years ago (in year t′). Thus, in the

These expressions are the ﬁrst and second convolutions encountered in this theory, of past sales with the survival
function and the probability of death. If sales ξi(t) are related in any way to the existing number of units, this produces
a self-correlation of the number of units with itself in past years. I will show later that this is eﬀectively the case,
which restricts how fast the total number of units can change in the system.10

10Note that in contrast to the birth function that I shall deﬁne further, ℓi(a) must be a strictly decreasing function of age otherwise dead units

would come back to life.

3.2. The birth process

The number of units of technology that can be built in a time span depends on the production capital and labour
available at that time. However, production capital also wears out as it ages (when it is not repaired) and has a ﬁnite
lifetime, and therefore its own survival function, which we denote ℓK
i (b), with age variable b. The production capital
K(b, t′), installed at time t′ of age b, will begin production after a certain delay of installation b0, and therefore its
age dependent productivity function, PK
i (b), is zero at b = 0 (see ﬁg. 3). The production decreases statistically with
i (b → ∞) = 0.11 The number of
age however, since production capital gradually break down with ageing following ℓK
units of technology produced per year by these production units of age b at time t during an interval of capital ageing
is therefore K(b, t)ℓK

i (b)PK

i (b)∆b.

Investment in new units of production capital is carried out using part of the income from the sale of produced
technology units (we assume, of technology of the exact same type, we do not mix funds across diﬀerent industries).
Taking Ri as the fraction of re-investment of proﬁts into production capital,12 the amount of capital of age b at time
u scales with sales that occurred b years earlier, i.e. K(b, t′) = Ri ξi(t′) = Ri ξi(t − b). The total production capacity
δNi(t) of all vintages can be calculated from the amount of capital that was built with funds from sales in all previous
years. Deﬁning the technology birth function mi(b) = PK

i (b)ℓK

i (b), this is

δNi(t) = RiZ ∞

0

ξi(t − b)mi(b)db,

(16)

where the diﬀerence between the production capacity and actual sales depends on the presence of competitors and
consumer choices.13 This is the third convolution of this theory, which generates, if the number of production units is
related to sales, another autocorrelation in the number of units.

As opposed to ℓi(a), mi(b) it is not a strictly decreasing function, but it increases initially, as production begins
some time after construction, before decreasing in later years when old production lines get decommissioned. It must
0 mi(b)db converges. As we show in section 4.3, in order to

be an integrable function, the area under which Φi = R ∞

have an increasing production capacity, we must have RΦi > 1.

The fastest possible rate of growth of sales can be calculated by hypothesising a ﬁctitious situation without com-
petition where households are able to consume any level of production, therefore with indeﬁnite growth (a ﬁctitious
purely supply-led market14). The production capital is under full employment and the total amount of production of
technology units is

ξi(t) = RiZ ∞

0

ξi(t − b)ℓK

i (b)PK

i (b)db.

(17)

Thus, in this monopolistic case sales that occur in the present are completely determined by sales in the past, where
the income on past sales were used to expand the production capacity, which enables more production and more
sales, and thus more expansion and so on. This is identical to renewal equations in demography where birth rates in
the present depend on what birth rates have been in the past (Keyﬁtz, 1977, Kot, 2001), also called Lotka’s integral
equation (Lotka, 1911). This leads to exponential solutions with possible oscillatory components (Keyﬁtz, 1967) for
both ξi(t) and K(t), therefore indeﬁnitely increasing sales and capital. Obviously, such a monopoly could never be
maintained indeﬁnitely and sales must presumably fall short of production at some point in time where a competitor
interferes with the market with a more successful product. However, in a situation where an innovation were to take
such a path free of competitors, it would follow the fastest possible rate t−1
of growth determined in Appendix A,
equal to either:

i

1. RiPi, the rate of investment in the case where the production capital lifetime is long-lived and only a short or no

delay takes place in its construction,

2. b0, the time delay, in case a long delay takes place in the construction of the production capital.

11We consider here repairs as investments in new production capital, in order to correctly keep track of the amount of depreciation.
12Ri is in units of production capital purchased per unit of technology sold.
13Whether the capital is fully used or whether there is spare capacity.
14It almost never happens that a rate of production growth determined solely by the supply side persists for a long time. For example in the
transport sector, if sales in developed nations were to increase faster than the population, this would mean that households eventually own 3-4-5 cars
and so on, rather unlikely. In this case, the rate of growth of sales is limited by the rate of growth of the demand, not the rate at which production
could hypothetically be scaled up given its proﬁtability. Supply-led growth however could arise in special circumstances such as in wartime policies
of rapid up-scaling.

Figure 4: Illustration of the process of decision-making under diversity of agents between two technologies. The blue curve represents the
distribution of perceived generalised costs for one technology, and the red curve that of the other. In the left panel, if diversity is very low, choices
can ﬂip very abruptly as average costs cross. This corresponds to the representative agent case. In the right panel, introducing signiﬁcant diversity
makes choices distributed and choices change very gradually as costs cross.

3.3. The choice process

As we know from diﬀusion theory (Rogers, 2010), the diversity of agents is linked to diﬀusion rates.

I thus
create a model of decision-making in the context of diverse agents. For a model of technology diﬀusion, we require
an aggregate representation of decision-making when agents are diverse, and costs have variations. Diversity stems
from diﬀerent perceptions from agents when they take a decision, which may originate from a large set of particular
preferences and constraints that is impossible to enumerate in a model. We require this diversity to be summarised by
distributions. For this, I assume that choice is made on the basis of a single quantity, a generalised cost x (ﬁgure 4
top), evaluated by agents for each option they see as available to them, and this value must feature a quantiﬁcation of
all possible aspects that weigh in the decision-making balance.

To clarify, I postulate here that distributions of perceived costs correspond to distributions of observed costs. I
justify it as follows: agents, I assume, when considering investing in a unit of technology (e.g. a car), most likely
choose something they have seen chosen before, perhaps by someone they know, such that they were able to gather
information.15 This may be due to their belonging to a particular social group and social class, and they are most
likely to choose amongst what their peers have previously chosen, which itself is a subset of what the whole market
has to oﬀer (e.g. poor rural households perhaps purchase diﬀerent types of vehicles to rich suburban families, which
itself is diﬀerent than single middle-class persons, i.e.
their peers are a subset of the population and their obser-
vations are a subset of all observations). This is a key part of what is known as the anthropology of consumption
(Douglas and Isherwood, 1979). Thus I assume restricted technology/information access, in other words, agents do
not choose what they do not know, and they do not know, or care for, all options technically available. Choices of par-
ticular social groups endure through peer observation and visual inﬂuence, which has been demonstrated empirically
for for example with vehicle purchases in the USA (McShane et al., 2012).

15i.e. they most likely do not choose something they know nothing of, and they gather reliable information predominantly through observations

of their peers

10

The frequency of events of observations of a particular technology model (by consumers shopping), sample of
an ensemble of such events, corresponds to the frequency of recent sales of that model (purchases by their peers). It
follows that the probability of choosing a particular model is most likely proportional to this frequency of observation,
and thus these preference distributions, associated to circumstances, constraints and social group origin of consumers,
diﬃcult to enumerate and unknown to the modeller, are relatively stable. These combined frequencies form a gener-
alised cost distributions of sales. Therefore in this perspective, the generalised cost distribution of recent sales is a
representation of the diversity of choices. I shall go further and claim that we can use the measured diversity of sales
and interpret it in terms of the diversity of agents. In such a perspective, technology sales by type and model reinforce
technology sales of those types and models, consistent with the work of McShane et al. (2012). This is a situation of
increasing returns to adoption, discussed by Arthur (1989), which, combined with diversity, he demonstrates leads to
path dependence and several equilibrium points.

This approach to modelling choice is not new, termed discrete choice theory (Ben-Akiva and Lerman, 1985,
McFadden, 1973), where the generalised cost being minimised (ﬁgure 4) is equivalent to the random utility being
maximised in the more classical version of the theory. In binary logit form, the description of decision-making is
represented here using pairwise comparisons of cost distributions (ﬁgure 4, top). When faced with equivalent technol-
ogy choices, the fraction of investors or consumers choosing technology i over j can be approximated by counting the
number of instances out of the total where the generalised cost of technology i falls below every possible other value of
the generalised cost of technology j, and vice-versa. Following standard discrete choice theory if the distributions are
of the Gumbel type (extreme value distributions), with standard deviations (diversity) σi and σ j, then the frequency
where technology i is less costly than technology j follows a logistic distribution (the binary logit in eq. 7), of width
j. The pairwise comparison generates a choice likelihood of adopting i over j that I denote
Fi j, and a likelihood of adopting j over i F ji = 1 − Fi j. This is derived exactly and explained further in Appendix B.
Finally, one comment may be added concerning innovation. Technologies are not static but change as production
methods improve, and these improvements occur through re-investment and production. Innovation in the ﬁrm leads to
learning-by-doing cost reductions, which inﬂuences the choices of agents (e.g. McDonald and Schrattenholzer, 2001,
Weiss et al., 2012). In particular, the costs of new technologies typically change faster than those of the incumbent.

parameter σi j = qσ2

i + σ2

Learning curves, of the usual form Ci(t) ∝ (R ξi(t)dt)−b (cumulated sales) can easily be included in the decision-

making process described here.

4. An age structured model of technology competition

4.1. Deaths replaced by births

I now build a model of technology competition and substitution. Choices of consumers or investors are taken to
mean what choices would be made if all options were not equally available or known to all agents. This is deﬁned in
terms of preferences in the comparison of each possible pairs of technologies Fi j. Given that despite the ﬁrst choice
of consumers or investors, those may not necessarily be available in every individual situations due to the amount of
existing industrial capacity to produce them, consumers or investors may have to content themselves with their second
or third choice. This is important here since we are dealing with technology diﬀusion, and that the diﬀusion process
involves a gradually changing availability of new technologies.

Considering that units of any age are replaced by new ones when they come to the end of their life and are
scrapped,16 following this approach, I evaluate the number of units removed from one arbitrary technology category
j and added into another category i. For this, I start with the total number of deaths to be replaced in all vehicle
categories and ages, and ﬁnd how many of those belong to category j. Out of those destructions in j, I evaluate those
that were chosen by consumers to be replaced by technology i, according to Fi j.

Of these, only a fraction can be produced. The production capacity of a particular technology may not necessarily
be able to supply the demand in every one of these situations, were the consumers to all simultaneously choose this
technology. Therefore, in a certain number of these situations, the option will simply not be available, and consumers

units, and whether they change ownership, is not relevant, which enables to make abstraction of second-hand markets.

11

will have to choose between the remaining options despite their best preference. The fraction of instances where
this choice will be available with respect to the total number of choices being made corresponds to the fraction of
production capacity of this technology with respect to the total production capacity.

This can be understood through an analogy involving an ensemble of shops with a number of competing products
on their shelves, and agent only go to their local shop, and thus each see a diﬀerent set of options. Given the production
capacity of each product’s respective industry, most shops will not be able to stock units of all competing products.
The relative frequency of shops stocking particular technology models corresponds to the relative production capacity
for those models. When customers have equal preferences for all products, the relative probability of the average
customer choosing particular products corresponds to the average composition of the product choice in the ensemble
of shops, which itself corresponds to relative production capacity of each product with respect to the total. Thus the
fraction of units of technology j, chosen to be replaced by technology i, that can actually be replaced by units of i
corresponds to the fraction of the total production capacity that produces technology i.

I deﬁne a ﬂow of units from categories j to i as follows:

Note the symmetry between the production side and the destruction side of this equation. There is, eﬀectively, a
high similarity between both processes. The diﬀerence however is fundamental: while ℓ(a) is a strictly decreasing
normalised function of age and smaller than 1, generating destruction only, Rim(b) increases, and its integral is greater
than 1, generating production. However, in order not to have an indeﬁnitely increasing production capacity, m(b)
also decreases again at high values of b, maintaining the function integrable17, generating decreases in the production
capacity when sales decrease, reﬂecting the gradual depreciation and wearing out of the production capital if no funds
are available to replace them.

Eq. 19 with eq. 21 provide an expression for exchanges of units between categories (the exchange term). However,
the total number, the carrying capacity, could also be changing, requiring either units that are brought in that do not
replace deaths, or deaths that are not replaced. In the more common case of a total population Ntot increasing, this is
met by technology production following the relative production capacity:

where choices need not be involved.18 Meanwhile in the second less common case, the decrease in Ntot is met by the
relative rate of deaths,

This fully recurrent population growth equation expresses how sales in the present are constrained by sales in the past
within and between categories, through convolutions, generating self and cross-correlations of the sales. Since sales
are autocorrelated in time, and that the addition of units corresponds to sales and removals to deaths, it implies that
the absolute numbers of units are self and cross-correlated in time as well. Therefore, changes in the numbers of units
cannot happen faster than is allowed by these correlations, which as we demonstrate next, are given by the length in
time of the functions ℓi(a) and mi(b).

Going any further requires evaluating all the convolutions, which would involve full knowledge of sales ξi(t) in
addition to survival functions ℓi(a) and birth functions mi(b). This equation can however be simpliﬁed enormously
with the two following approximations.

4.3. Simpliﬁcation of the model with key approximations

Eq. 24 in its full form, or alternatively eq. 25, appear rather complicated, unconstrained and un-instructive. How-
ever, since they are recurrent, these equations are more constrained in terms of their possible solutions than they
seem. Eq. 24 expresses technological change between technology categories in terms of respective sales of those
technologies. These sales are convolved with the functions m(b) and dℓ(a)/da. It is well known in signal processing
theory that convolutions of time series with functions of bounded kernels (ﬁg. 5) yield slightly modiﬁed time series
that are smoothed with respect to the original, where high frequency changes have been damped.20 The ‘cutoﬀ’ value
at which frequencies are suppressed, the sharpness limit, corresponds to the width in time of the kernel.21 This is also
the correlation length of the smoothed function. For symmetrical normalised kernels of similar widths but diﬀerent
shapes, the convolution of a function leads to very similar results since a similar frequency cutoﬀ occurs, and the same
amount of damping occurs. If a kernel is not normalised, it either ampliﬁes the time series (its integral is greater than
one) or damps it (its integral less than one). If both kernels are not normalised but of similar widths, the convolutions
will yield results which are close to multiples of each other, with proportionality factor the relative area under the ker-
nels.22 Finally, if the kernels are not symmetrical functions, as is the case here, a time oﬀset may appear between the

18Adding here a factor Fi j can be done but is secondary: even if new units are not chosen exchanges can occur through the exchange term.
19Thus improvements could be made using stochastic population growth theory, where for instance the probability of extinction at low population

numbers would be better represented.

20i.e. a ‘low-pass’ ﬁlter.
21In this case both m(b) and dℓ(a)/da; the wider the kernel, the lower the frequency cutoﬀ and the more smoothing occurs.
22This results from the convolution theorem.

two convolved outputs. This is demonstrated with a computational example shown in ﬁgure 5, where a hypothetical
noisy time series (sales) was convolved with hypothetical birth and death functions. The result is almost independent
of the shape of these functions, except for a proportionality factor, the relative area under the two kernel functions (the
time oﬀset results from the asymmetry in time of the kernels). In our case here with the birth and survival functions
as kernels, this relative factor is RiΦi/τi.

Approximation 1: the shape of the death function

The ﬁrst kernel, dℓi(a)/da, is normalised by deﬁnition (expressing an eventual but certain death), while the life

expectancy is deﬁned by eq. 11:

Z ∞

da = 1, Z ∞

ℓ j(a)da = τi.

Since the shape of the kernel does not matter much for the convolutions as long as its width in time is maintained, for
our purpose we can approximate that,

−

dℓ j(a)

This means that from eq. 14, which relates numbers to sales through the survival function, the convolution for deaths

The second kernel, the birth function m j(b), has the following property,

Conversely, if the widths are very diﬀerent, they cannot in any way be proportional or even similar. The width of the

ti is the newly deﬁned fastest possible timescale of growth of the production capacity before considering investor

Thus with these approximations, I can replace the convolutions in eqns. 21 and 24 by N j/t j and Ni/τi, which

considerably simpliﬁes the system of coupled equations.

This replicator dynamics equation, in the binary form (imitation dynamics), has an antisymmetric exchange matrix
αi j = Ai jF ji − A jiF ji.

15

I have thus described the rate of uptake, αi j = Ai jF ji − A jiF ji, completely in terms of technology, market properties
and choice of agents. These values can thus be compared to real diﬀusion timescales or used to parameterise diﬀusion
dynamics in technology models in cases where such data is not available. Note that diﬀusion timescales are not
related to the properties of individual technologies but, rather, to the properties of pairs of technologies plus investor
choices. This shows that diﬀusion timescales measured from historical time series are, in actuality, abstractions of
many underlying processes that include decision-making, and should be understood to refer only to the decision
context where they apply; they cannot be expected to represent other contexts where other choices might have been
made.24

As a ﬁnal note, I ask, can this theory be put into a form that uses a multinomial logit instead, leading perhaps to
a diﬀerent form of the replicator equation? Appendix C presents in a demonstration that this is indeed approximately
the case, where by grouping the binary logit terms, the classical multinomial logit is obtained. This naturally leads to
a replicator equation of the classical form used in evolutionary theory,

∆S i = S i(cid:16)Fi(~S ) − F (~S )(cid:17) ∆t,

(38)

which is expressed in terms of the diﬀerence between the ﬁtness Fi, in the evolutionary theory sense, of technology i,
to the average ﬁtness F . This, however, is an approximation of the more accurate and practically usable binary system.
The binary system is, eﬀectively, probably the only way to correctly incorporate restricted access to technology and
information, which introduces a diﬀerentiation between options as seen by the agent, as opposed to a comparison with
the ‘average’ alternative.

5. How to use this theory: Interpretation of the Lotka-Volterra scaling parameters

5.1. Constraints and applicability of the Lotka-Volterra model

The Lotka-Volterra model is a special case of the general model derived here from demography theory. This

section summarises the constraints under which this applies:

1. The birth and death functions have similar approximate widths in time,
2. The area under the birth function for technology i, Φi, times the reinvestment fraction Ri, must be greater than

one for a technology to be able to replicate itself.

One then ﬁnds that, according to eq. 30, RiΦi determines the growth time constant in terms of the lifetime: ti = τi/RiΦi,
where

the integral determining the total expected production by one unit of capital over its lifetime. Furthermore, since the
productivity constant, after a possible delay of installation, is independent of age, then it can be further approximated
to 1/ti = RiPiτK
i /τi ≃ RiPi. Thus we unsurprisingly ﬁnd again that the rate of reinvestment RiPi determines the
magnitude of the fastest possible rate of growth of the production capacity t−1
(see section 3.2 and Appendix A).
Thus in order for the industry to grow, such that ti < τi, one must have that RiΦi > 1, Φi representing the expected
cumulative production of one installed unit of production capital during its lifetime.

i

From this, strict constraints can be determined that provide insight over which systems can be modelled using the
Lotka-Volterra set of equations (LVEs) at the technology unit level:25 Furthermore, this model is also a deterministic
one that does not include the process of generation of new technologies directly. The following are the factors that
limit its predictive power:

1. If the lifetime of the production capital and that of the technology units it produces is very diﬀerent, the LVEs

are not appropriate when used at the unit level.26

24Given, say, a diﬀerent set of possibilities available to investors.
25LVE systems can be applied at other levels, e.g. ﬁrms. This may provide ways to deal with cases excluded here, requiring further research.
26E.g. the mobile phone industry, in which phones have very short lifetimes, or infrastructure industries where the capital, e.g. houses, roads and

bridges, have much longer lifetimes than the ﬁrms building them, potentially maintained forever.

16

2. The producing ﬁrms must have an intended propensity towards expansion, and must reinvest enough proﬁts
to expand their production capacity, which will only decline if sales decline due to a lack of interest by in-
vestors/consumers (i.e. Ri roughly constant). In a case where a ﬁrm has made a decision not to maintain a
technology under production despite that it is proﬁtable, the Lotka-Volterra model breaks down.

3. In evaluating the evolution of the market shares of ﬁrms for a particular market, the technology unit used in the
Lotka-Volterra equation is crucial. This must be service producing technologies at the unit level (e.g. ovens,
power plants, vehicles of diﬀerent engine types, lighting devices, etc), not the service itself (e.g. a piece of
bread, a kWh, a transport service, light) or long-lived infrastructure (e.g. houses or buildings, roads, airports,
sets of transmission lines, bridges) likely to be maintained for lengths of time beyond foreseeable future.27

4. Innovation is not included directly in the demography/diﬀusion model, which does not predict the generation
of new technologies, which could disrupt the diﬀusion of the other existing ones (e.g. the diﬀusion of fusion
power). However, some aspects of innovation can, and should be, included through learning-by-doing cost
reductions, which can easily be included in the decision model as described above (although the rates are
uncertain). This approach narrows down possibilities for existing technologies for the near future (e.g. during
several life expectancies), which is itself quite robust, since it is well established that the formation of dominant
designs is itself a lengthy process (e.g.
the diﬀusion of fusion power). This limitation aﬀects the realistic
modelling time horizon.

5. Finally, this theory requires to be fully validated with historical data beyond existing empirical work, outside

the scope of the present paper.

5.2. How to use this theory in real models

Summarising this theory, for real models, both the industrial dynamics Ai j and the decision-making Fi j processes

must be parameterised and used in the replicator equation for market shares S i,

∆S i = Xj

S iS j(cid:16)Ai jFi j − A jiF ji(cid:17) ∆t

τ

,

(40)

requiring of course starting share values obtained from real-world data, and an absolute time scaling constant τ, the
average life expectancy (see below).

Industrial dynamics Ai j

Using the theory given above to parameterise a computational model of technology diﬀusion boils down to deter-

mining two parameters per technology: ti and τi,

τi = Z ∞

0

ℓi(a)da,

ti =

(41)

with τi the life expectancy from the survival function, and ti the fastest possible growth rate in terms of the re-
investment rate Ri (in units re-invested per unit sold) and the productivity Pi (in units produced per year), and τ−1, t−1
are share weighted averages of the inverse of the time constants,

1
t

S i(t)

and

τ

.

(42)

Then this is put into the changeover timescale matrix for every possible pair of technologies Ai j.

Further simpliﬁcations are possible however. Since these timescales ti and τi only ever appear as ratios with their
averages t and τ, the common scaling factors cancel out.28 Therefore, for instance, it is not the absolute value of ti

27This model does not apply at the ﬁrm level, as was done in Atkeson and Kehoe (2007).
28Note however that knowledge of the absolute value of τ, the absolute time scaling factor, appears on its own in the equation and is thus

necessary.

17

that determines the rate of technology uptake, but its ratio with the average, in other words, how much faster is a
technology able to ﬁll gaps in the market in comparison to other technologies.

Furthermore, for technologies with long times of construction, for similar fractions of proﬁt re-invested into pro-
duction between technologies Ri, the productivity Pi scales with the inverse of the time of construction, the time a ﬁrm
has to wait before allocating its production capacity to new projects, and thus t/ti = Pi/P (e.g. power sector), equal
to the ratio of the time of construction with the average, other parameters cancelling out. If times of construction are
the same, however, but Ri vary, then the Pi cancel out and the ratio Ri/R must be used. Or it can also be that ti simply
cancels out with t altogether and the τi broadly determine timescales of changeover (e.g. the car industry).

Technology choice Fi j

Fi j must be evaluated using a binary logit. This can be parameterised using measured cost distributions of sales,
in which the diversity of past choices is represented. In the common case where small amounts of information on
agents is available beyond cost distributions, the simplest approach is to parameterise the Gumbel or other type of
distributions on the cost data, obtaining in this way a mean cost Ci and a standard deviation σi for every technology.
Note that the shape of the distribution does not matter signiﬁcantly in practice. The simple form of the binary logit
can then be used for each technology category:

Fi j =

1

1 + e∆Ci j/σi j

, ∆Ci j = Ci − C j, σi j = qσ2

i + σ2

6. Conclusion

This work demonstrates that the origin of the empirical observation of the applicability of the Lotka-Volterra or
replicator dynamics models of competition dynamics to technology diﬀusion can be derived from demographic princi-
ples applied to technology. I have created an age structured model of technology demography, using life expectancies
and birth rates which, given the right conditions, using an approximation, falls back onto the form of the well known
empirical Lotka-Volterra and replicator dynamics models of competition. This procedure explains on the way the
nature of the scaling parameters of the Lotka-Volterra equation, the timescales of technology diﬀusion, in terms of
survival properties of technology and industrial dynamics stemming from investment.

The calculation presented however generates more insight than the simple correspondence of the Lotka-Volterra
system to demography. While every previous quantitative use of the Lotka-Volterra system for modelling technology
diﬀusion has remained empirical and without clear explanation of its parameterisation, the calculation presented here
explains why the Lotka-Volterra actually describes well systems of competing technologies at all. It moreover clariﬁes
under which conditions it applies. Meanwhile, this paper gives meaning of the timescales of technology population
dynamics measured empirically.

By clarifying the meaning of the scaling constants of the Lotka-Volterra model, this theory enables its use with
a method for its parameterisation without prior empirical measurement, the latter diﬃcult to achieve in cases where
only small amounts of data are available. This tends to occur precisely in the cases of interest, namely when exploring
the diﬀusion potential of new technologies under diﬀerent assumptions over the market and policy environment. This
theory thus enables to build models of technology forecasting based on S -shaped diﬀusion curves and to parameterise
them using known properties of the technologies and those of their respective production industries. This method,
as used for instance in earlier work (Mercure, 2012, Mercure et al., 2014), can in principle replace the optimisation
algorithms in mainstream models which have little theoretical foundation. This opens many possibilities for modelling
future technology pathways, for instance for analysing the impacts of policy supporting the diﬀusion of low carbon
technology.

Appendix A. : Growth under full employment

In a situation where an innovation was to follow a path free of competitors and grow as fast as its industry can

produce it, it would follow the fastest possible rate t−1

This is a transcendental equation that can only be solved numerically. As demonstrated by Lotka (1911) (see Kot,
2001, for a clearer derivation), it has only one real solution, all others being complex of the form u ± iv which give
rise to oscillatory behaviour in the real part. The non-oscillatory real solution, an exponential, can be approximated if
simple forms are taken for ℓ(b) and P(b) (see ﬁg. 3, right):

where b0 is the time between investment and construction, Pi is a production rate and therefore (RiPi)−1 is the rate of
expansion of production capacity (in inverse years), and τK
is the timescale of capital depreciation, its life expectancy
i
(and therefore we always have τK
i >> b0). To ﬁrst order, one can ﬁnd which is the dominant of these timescales in
particular situations, using limits for the dimensionless parameter RiPib0 (which determines the slope of the linear left
hand side of the equation, see graph).

Since RiPi cannot be a very small quantity, it is most likely that b0 << (RiPi)−1, for instance with small technologies

that are ready to use as they come out of the factory (e.g. vehicles). And since RiPi >> 1/τK
this case the rate of production is constrained by the rate of re-investment into production capacity, which depends
on the rate of production of technology units but not on the time of construction of production capacity. For large
systems (e.g. power plants, wind turbines, infrastructure), the time of construction may be long (i.e. several years),
constraining money ﬂows used for ﬁrm expansions. For small modular technologies (e.g. electronics), the time of
production is short and other timescales dominate the time ‘bottleneck’.

Case 2: (RiPib0) is of order 1 ⇒ λb0 ≃ 1

We perform a Taylor expansion around λb0 = 1,

λ = RiPie−1 (1 − (b0λ − 1) − ...) ⇒ ti ≃ "

to come to completion and income to be brought in before launching itself into further expansions.

Case 3: (RiPib0) is large ⇒ λb0 is large

No Taylor expansion is possible. However if RiPie−λb0 → 1/τK

and the timescale of expansion diverges. This corresponds to a case where a ﬁrm struggles with its cash ﬂows to
maintain its production capacity. Beyond this the timescale can also become negative, where a ﬁrm scales down its
activities.

Thus in many cases one of the three timescales dominates, the bottleneck timescale.

In other cases, if two

timescales are similar, ti must be calculated numerically using eq. 44.

These three cases however only occur if consumers are ready to buy all that this particular industry is able to
produce, and consequently its growth is limited by its ability to expand. If, however, the demand grows more slowly
than these maximal rates, then the demand constrains the rate of growth, a demand-led case. Furthermore, if con-
sumers have a choice of products and competition occurs, then the rate of growth is further constrained and a model
of competition must be derived, as done in section 4.

Appendix B. : A binary logit choice model

A model of choice is constructed here using a pairwise comparison, which will be performed for all possible
pairs in order to rank exhaustively consumer preferences, the latter being distributed.
I use for this generalised
cost distribution of sales obtained from recent sales data. This calculation is the basis of discrete choice theory
adapted to the purposes of this work, and more information can be obtained in Ben-Akiva and Lerman (1985) and
Domencich and McFadden (1975).

I assume two distributions for the relative numbers of situations where agents, stating their individual preference
between technologies i and j, face diﬀerent situations and state diﬀerent choices. By counting how many agents
prefer which technology in each pair, one can determine what the probabilities of preferences between these two
technologies are for future situations where choices are to be made (e.g. 70% of agents choose i and 30% j). It does
not mean however that when the time comes to invest or purchase, these are the choices that would be made, since
depending on the state of diﬀusion of these technologies, they might not necessarily be available to every agent. By
going through an exhaustive list of pairwise preferences, ﬁnal choices can be determined.

I denote these (normalised) distributions f (C, Ci, σi)dC = fi(C −Ci)dC and f (C, C j, σ j)dC = f j(C −C j)dC, where
Ci, C j are the means and σi, σ j are the standard deviations for technologies i and j. These distributions can be of any
kind, but they require to have a single well deﬁned maximum and variance (e.g. they cannot have two maxima29). I
can then evaluate the probability of choosing i over j using the following. First, I calculate the probability of choosing
i in all cases where j has an arbitrary cost C. The central assumption here is that the fraction of agents for whom the
generalised cost of j is C and for whom the cost for i is lower than C will choose technology i over j if given a choice,
and this fraction is equal to the cumulative probability distribution Fi(C − Ci). But this situation occurs a fraction
f j(C − C j) of the time, giving a total probability

while the converse is

P(Ci < C|C j = C) = Fi(C − Ci) f j(C − C j)dC,

P(C j < C|Ci = C) = F j(C − C j) fi(C − Ci)dC.

(48)

(49)

In order to evaluate how often the cost of technology i is lower than that of technology j, and the converse, a sum over
all possible values of C must be taken. For simplicity, I use as variables C′ = C − C j and C′′ = C − Ci, with the mean

29In which case we would need to subdivide such a technology category into two.

20

cost diﬀerence ∆C = Ci − C j:

Fi j(∆C) = P(Ci < C j) = Z +∞

−∞

Fi(C′ − ∆C) f j(C′)dC′,

F ji(∆C) = 1 − Fi j = P(C j < Ci) = Z +∞

−∞

F j(C′′ + ∆C) fi(C′′)dC′′.

(50)

This appears diﬃcult without further knowledge of the distribution type, however it is possible to take a derivative
with respect to ∆C, which makes the integral a convolution of the two distributions

fi(C′ − ∆C) f j(C′)dC′ = − fi j(∆C)

∞

fi(C′′) f j(C′′ + ∆C)dC′′ = − f ji(−∆C) =

dF ji
d∆C

.

(51)

(52)

This convolution yields a new distribution fi j(∆C)d∆C of which the standard deviation is σi j = qσ2

j. This
is the probability distribution of technology switching in terms of ∆C. The convolution having been computed, this
distribution can be integrated again as a function of ∆C to yield a cumulative probability distribution that the cost of
technology i is less than that of j (and conversely):

i + σ2

Fi j(∆C) = Z +∞

−∞

fi j(∆C)d∆C = 1 −Z +∞

−∞

f ji(∆C)d∆C = 1 − F ji(∆C).

(53)

Thus given a choice between technologies i and j, the fraction Fi j of agents tends to choose technology i and the
fraction F ji chooses j, these fractions being functions of the generalised cost diﬀerence, and this cumulative choice
j. Note that this calculation is independent
of probability distribution type; however Fi j(∆C) should have roughly the shape of a ‘smooth’ step function, its
‘smoothness’ determined roughly by the widths of both cost distributions.

function has a width that follows the sum of the squares σi j = qσ2

In discrete choice theory, the Gumbel distribution is often used, fi = e−e−(C−Ci )/σi , and the result of the convolution of
two Gumbel distributions is a logistic distribution of the average cost diﬀerence ∆Ci j relative to the root mean square
width σi j:

i + σ2

fi = e−e−(C−Ci )/σi , Fi j = Z ∞

1 + e∆Ci j/σi j

.

(54)

Appendix C. : From the binary to the multinomial logit in the replicator equation

The derivation of the binary logit in Appendix B gives a relationship between the cost probability distributions
and the cumulative distribution of choice between two options fi and f j (with parameters Ci, σi and C j, σ j), as a
convolution, consistent with Domencich and McFadden (1975). The probability of cost of option i being less than the
cost of option j is

P(Ci < C j) =

dFi j
d∆Ci j

= −Z +∞

−∞

fi(C′ − ∆Ci j) f j(C′)dC′ = fi ∗ f j,

(55)

the star denoting a convolution. The binary form of the replicator dynamics equation requires summing the result of
binary choices, however distributions can be ﬁrst grouped and afterwards convolved:

d∆Ci j.

(56)

In this picture, each cost distribution of possible alternatives f j is weighted by the factor Ai jS j which involves shares
and changeover timescales. This weighted sum of distributions results in a composite distribution with new mean

Ai jFi jS j = Z ∞

−∞

Xj

fi ∗Xj

Ai jS j f j



21

and standard deviation parameters C and σ.30, which cannot be expressed analytically in any simpler form. The
convolution corresponds roughly to the probability that the cost of option i is less than the cost of the ‘average’
alternative (with average cost C) weighted by the frequency of occurrence of these choices, P(C < C|Ci = C).

As an approximation, I replace this ‘average’ probability distribution with that of an arbitrary cost value C being
lower than the minimum of all available alternatives simultaneously. This corresponds to the product of the individual
distributions,

P (C < min[C1, C2, C3...Cn]) = P(C < C1)P(C < C2)...P(C < Cn).

When the weighting of these choices is equal, if each of these probability functions are Gumbel, then the result of this

is also a Gumbel distribution, of cost parameter proportional to lnP j e−C j/σ j, a classic result of discrete choice theory

when deriving the multinomial logit (Ben-Akiva and Lerman, 1985, p. 105). Equal weighting in the multinomial logit
corresponds to perfect access to information and technology options by all agents. In the theory presented here, each
agent has access to a diﬀerent set of choices, which, when correctly weighted, is

P(C < C1)Ai1S 1 P(C < C2)Ai2S 2 ...P(C < Cn)AinS n ,

P (C < min[C1, C2, C3...Cn]|Ci = C) = Fi(Ci − C)Yj

P(C < C j)Ai jS j .

The weighted (representative alternative) cost parameter is instead

ˆC = ˆσ lnXj

Ai jS je

−C j
σ j .

(57)

(58)

This unequal weighting of alternatives is generally overlooked in discrete choice theory, but crucial when exploring
the diﬀusion of technology since part of the dynamics stem from restricted access to options in early states of diﬀusion.
Following Appendix B, the convolution becomes

This is the multinomial logit weighted by Ai jS j, i.e. adjusted for restricted access to alternatives. I now deﬁne the

This is the ﬁtness of a technology to capture the market, a growth minus a survival term.31 The average ﬁtness is then

Thus the replicator dynamics equation (eq. 37) can in fact be written as

F = Xj

S jF j = 1 − 1 = 0.

∆S i = S i(cid:16)Fi − F(cid:17) ∆t.

(61)

(62)

This is the classical replicator dynamics equation in general evolutionary theory (e.g. Hofbauer and Sigmund, 1998),
where the ability of a proponent option or biological specie to capture market or space is proportional to the diﬀerence
of its ﬁtness to the average ﬁtness.

30C is the weighted average, while σ2 is the weighted sum of the square of the standard deviations.
31Producing faster (smaller ti) increases competitiveness and therefore the ﬁtness, while surviving for longer (larger τi) decreases vulnerability

to changes and thus also improves the ﬁtness.

22

This transformation however has required an approximation which is a simpliﬁcation of the distribution of alter-
natives. This is a useful simpliﬁcation for the sake of exposition, but leads to a less accurate form of the replicator
equation and associated market response. This is due to leaving out, at eq. 57, some of the details of the restricted
access to technology and information, as well as the complexity emerging from interactions.32 The binary form es-
sentially maintains the information as to which options are seen by which agent in aggregate. It is however heavier
computationally since it involves pairwise comparisons, which scales as n2/2 − n for the binary form, compared to n
for the multinomial form (n the number of options).
