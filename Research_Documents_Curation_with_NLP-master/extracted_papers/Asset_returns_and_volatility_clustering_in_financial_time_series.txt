Abstract

An analysis of the stylized facts in ﬁnancial time series is carried out. We
ﬁnd that, instead of the heavy tails in asset return distributions, the slow
decay behaviour in autocorrelation functions of absolute returns is actually
directly related to the degree of clustering of large ﬂuctuations within the
ﬁnancial time series. We also introduce an index to quantitatively measure
the clustering behaviour of ﬂuctuations in these time series and show that
big losses in ﬁnancial markets usually lump more severely than big gains. We
further give examples to demonstrate that comparing to conventional meth-
ods, our index enables one to extract more information from the ﬁnancial
time series.

1. Introduction

In ﬁnancial markets, prices of stocks and commodities ﬂuctuate over time
which then produce ﬁnancial time series. These time series are in fact of
great interest both to practitioners and theoreticians for making inferences
and predictions. Using modern day technologies, one can now obtain a vast
amount of ﬁnancial data that record every transaction in ﬁnancial markets
which was not possible a couple of decades ago. The analysis involved is also
far more complicated. With the tremendous amount of information obtained

over the past decade, researchers have now come to agree on several stylized
facts about ﬁnancial markets, i.e., heavy tails (or fat tails in the terminol-
ogy of ﬁnance) in asset return distributions, absence of autocorrelations of
asset returns, volatility clustering, aggregational normality and asymmetry
between rises and falls [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Figure 1 (a) shows a plot of the histori-
cal daily closing values of NASDAQ Composite index from February 8, 1971
through June 30, 2009 while ﬁgure 1 (b) is its daily price returns during this
period. The price return Rτ (t) at time t is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between
the price p(t) of a ﬁnancial asset (here it is the index value of NASDAQ) at
time t and its price a time τ before, p(t − τ ), divided by p(t − τ ),

Normalized daily returns

Figure 2: The probability density function of the normalized daily returns of the NASDAQ
index in ﬁgure 1.

Therefore, one can obtain the daily returns R1(t) by setting τ = 1 trading day
and these returns reﬂect the price ﬂuctuations in this time series. We will use
daily returns to deﬁne ﬂuctuations in a ﬁnancial price series throughout this
article. As one can see in ﬁgure 1 (b) that the daily returns are varying over
time. A naive thinking would be that these ﬂuctuations are independent,
identically distributed (iid) variables generated by some random processes
(i.e., random walks [6]) and therefore the probability density function of the
returns should follow a Gaussian distribution. However, it turns out that the
empirical distributions of the returns are indeed heavy-tailed. In ﬁgure 2,
we depict the probability density function of normalized daily returns of the
NASDAQ index. The normalized daily return is deﬁned as (R1(t) − µR) /σR,
where µR and σR denote the average and the standard deviation of R1(t). One
can clearly see that there are heavy tails at the two ends of the distribution.
For comparison, we also include a Gaussian ﬁt with µ = 0 and σ = 1. This
is one of the stylized facts that was discovered back in 1960s [7, 8]. Many
studies have been carried out over the years on diﬀerent ﬁnancial time series
and the heavy tails in return distributions have always been observed. There
have been many suggestions on the form of the distributions but no general
consensus has been reached on the exact form of the tails so far. We will
not continue our discussion on this issue here but refer our reader to the
literature [4, 5, 9, 10].

Figure 3: The autocorrelation functions of the returns and its absolute value.

In addition to those heavy tails in return distributions, large ﬂuctuations
in prices seem to lump together as well [11, 12]. If one examines the empirical
time series shown in ﬁgure 1, it is easy to observe that large ﬂuctuations in
prices are more often followed by large ones while small ﬂuctuations are
more likely followed by small ones. This stylized fact is known as volatility
clustering [13]. In ﬁnancial time series, it is not just that there are more large
ﬂuctuations than pure random processes but also these large ﬂuctuations tend
to cluster together. It is often suggested that a more quantitative way to view
this property is to look at the autocorrelations of the return series [12]. The
autocorrelation function C (xt, xt+τ ) is deﬁned as

,

(2)

C (xt, xt+τ ) ≡ h(xt − hxti) (xt+τ − hxt+τi)i
t+τi − hxt+τi2

2i − hxti2qhx2

qhxt

where hxi denotes the expectation value of the variable x. While the returns
themselves do not show the evidence of temporal correlations, the absolute
returns or their squares do display a positive, pronounced slowly decaying
autocorrelation which indeed exhibit power-law decay behaviour. The au-
tocorrelations of the absolute value or the square, etc of the asset returns
are often known as the nonlinear autocorrelations. We will only consider
the autocorrelation of the absolute returns as an example of the nonlinear
autocorrelation in this paper.

absolute value for the time series shown in ﬁgure 1. It is easy to see that there
is no correlation among the returns since the autocorrelation function drops
to the noise level within a couple of days. On the other hand, the autocorrela-
tion function of the absolute returns, i.e., the nonlinear autocorrelation does
exhibit a much slower decay behaviour. Researchers have ﬁtted this with a
power-law decay, and it is not clear at this moment whether the slow decay
should imply long time memory of the ﬁnancial time series [13]. However,
one should also keep in mind that if the time series do possess the properties
of the long time memory and the heavy-tailed distribution, many standard
estimation procedures (i.e., examining sample autocorrelations.) may fail to
work [13, 14, 15]. Therefore, in order to have a more reliable measurement of
the volatility clustering, an alternative approach is also needed while dealing
with ﬁnancial time series. For instance, if only the clustering behaviour is
concerned, one can simply characterize this property by the concept of prob-
ability. Table 1 is an example which shows the probability of the occurrence
of large and small ﬂuctuations following the occurrence of large or small ﬂuc-
tuations on the previous day. By large (small) ﬂuctuations, we here choose
them to be the largest (smallest) 20% of all the returns and the remaining
returns are denoted as the rest. Therefore, each row in table 1 sums to unity.
It is easy to see that the probability that there will be a large (small) re-
turn following a large (small) one on the previous day is signiﬁcantly higher
(larger than 20% in this case) than that of a pure random process.

A natural question to ask is whether the above stylized facts are indeed
related to each other and if so, is it possible for one to understand its ori-
gin. In the following, we will give an attempt to answer the ﬁrst question
which would hopefully shed light on searching for an answer to the second
question. This paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we will give de-

5

tailed analysis of volatility clustering in ﬁnancial time series. In particular,
we give arguments on what ingredient in ﬁnancial time series is responsi-
ble for reproducing the nonlinear autocorrelations of price returns such as
the one shown in ﬁgure 3. We then introduce, in section 3, an index as a
quantitative measure of volatility clustering in ﬁnancial time series. This
would allow us to directly compare the degree of volatility clustering across
diﬀerent ﬁnancial time series. The asymmetry between rises (gains) and falls
(losses) in the time series will be discussed in section 4. Section 5 will be
the summary and discussion. In this work, we have carried out the analy-
sis on seven diﬀerent representative ﬁnancial time series. They include (i)
NASDAQ Composite Index (NASDAQ), (ii) Standard & Poor’s 500 index
(S&P500), (iii) Hang Seng Index (HSI), (iv) Microsoft stock price (MSFT),
(v) US Dollar/New Taiwan Dollar (USD/NTD), (vi) Australian Dollar/New
Taiwan Dollar (AUD/NTD) and (vii) West Texas Intermediate (WTI). While
we use NASDAQ as an example throughout the paper, we will include the
results of other ﬁnancial time series in the appendix.

2. Volatility clustering and autocorrelation functions

We now begin our study by looking into the question of whether there is a
relationship among the heavy tails of return distributions, volatility cluster-
ing and autocorrelation functions, if the answer is yes, how they are related.
Let us begin by asking the following question: Is it necessary for one to have
a heavy-tailed distribution in order for the nonlinear autocorrelation function
to exhibit the slow decay? To answer this question, let us now assume that
the return distribution follow a Gaussian distribution instead of the empir-
ical distribution shown in ﬁgure 2.
In this case, we assume the Gaussian
distribution to have its mean and standard deviation to be the same as the
mean and the standard deviation of the daily returns series in ﬁgure 1. One
can easily perform a simulation on this. We now draw an equal number of
returns from this Gaussian distribution and call it the simulated data set.
After this is done, we sort both the empirical set and the simulated set in
the descending order of absolute returns. We then substitute the values in
the empirical data set by the simulated data set one by one from the largest
ﬂuctuation to the smallest one and calculate the nonlinear autocorrelation
function of this rearranged Gaussian data. The result is presented in ﬁg-
ure 4. For comparison, we also include the nonlinear autocorrelation of the
empirical data and the result from a pure Gaussian noise which is drawn

from a Gaussian distribution but without arranging the data according to
the positions of empirical data set like we do for the rearranged Gaussian
data. The pure Gaussian noise shows no temporal correlations as expected.
What is surprising is that the rearranged Gaussian returns shows the same
kind of slow decay behaviour as the empirical data set. On the other hand,
if we randomize the temporal positions of the empirical returns, namely, we
reshuﬄe the original ﬁnancial time series, the result we obtain is always sim-
ilar to the case of the pure Gaussian noise, which means that there is no
temporal correlation. The above analysis therefore strongly suggests that
the heavy tails in return distributions are not responsible for the slow decay
behaviour of the nonlinear autocorrelation functions.

If the heavy tails in the distributions are not responsible for slow decay in
nonlinear autocorrelation functions, what possible ingredients in the ﬁnancial
time series would be responsible for such a slow decay behaviour. We here
try to provide an answer to this question. Let us begin by looking at the
clustering of large price ﬂuctuations in ﬁgure 1. We begin by picking out the
largest p% (where p is a constant) ﬂuctuations (whether they are positive or
negative) in the time series1 and see whether their clustering behaviour would

1 A similar treatment, the return interval approach [16, 17, 18, 19], is to pick the large
ﬂuctuations that are outside q standard deviations of the average value of the returns,
where q is a pure number.

aﬀect the nonlinear autocorrelation function of the returns. Since we are only
interested in the clustering behaviour, which in turn means the temporal po-
sitions but not the values of the large ﬂuctuations in the ﬁnancial time series,
we can here simply use 1 to represent the largest p% ﬂuctuations and 0 for
all the other smaller ﬂuctuations. In this way, we will have a sequence which
contains only 0 and 1. This will in turn make our analysis much easier to
interpret. Figure 5 shows the nonlinear autocorrelation of ﬁgure 1 using 1
for the largest p% ﬂuctuations and 0 for the rest. We here include the results
for sequences with p = 10, 20 and 30. To facilitate our discussion, we also
include both the nonlinear autocorrelation for empirical data and the Gaus-
sian noise for comparison. One can see that all these sequences show similar
slow decay behaviour as the original empirical data set, though with smaller
values. This analysis thus shows that the positions of the large ﬂuctuations
are essential for a slow-decaying nonlinear autocorrelation function. There-
fore, one can conclude that it is the clustering of large ﬂuctuations rather
than the heavy tail in the return distribution which should be responsible for
the slow decay behaviour of nonlinear autocorrelation functions. This fact
has also been observed in the other ﬁnancial time series in our study and the
results are presented in the appendix.

Before we end this section, we would also like to make a further study

of the clustering of ﬂuctuations in ﬁnancial time series. Instead of looking
at the clustering of large ﬂuctuations, we now focus on the clustering of
the small ﬂuctuations in time series. Since small ﬂuctuations are smaller
in value and basically do not contribute to the nonlinear autocorrelation
functions, they are often left out in the discussion in the literature. However,
whether their temporal positions in a time series can have similar eﬀects as
the large ﬂuctuations is an interesting question that one can ask. In ﬁgure 6
(a), we plot the historical daily return time series of the currency exchange
rate USD/NTD from July 2, 2001 through June 30, 2009, where the black
line denotes the original empirical returns while the red one represents the
same set but with the largest 20% and smallest 20% of the returns being
swapped 2. The nonlinear autocorrelations of the original empirical returns
(line with open circles) and the swapped returns (line with triangles) are
drawn in ﬁgure 6 (b). We also include in this ﬁgure the autocorrelation
function of the original returns for comparison. One can see that although
the line with triangles has values smaller than the original data set, both lines
have similar slow decay behaviour. This in turn means that the clustering of
small ﬂuctuations in this returns series has basically the same kind of feature
as that of their large ﬂuctuation counterparts. On the other hand, as we
swap the large and small ﬂuctuations in the other six ﬁnancial time series
that we have been investigating, the nonlinear autocorrelation functions of
the swapped returns series show no sign of slow decay. They basically drop
very fast, similar to the kind of Gaussian noise in ﬁgure 4. This interesting
fact will be discussed in more detail in the next section as we introduce a
clustering index to quantitatively study the clustering behaviour of diﬀerent
ﬁnancial time series. The introduction of this index would then allow us to
directly compare the degree of clustering across diﬀerent ﬁnancial time series.

3. Quantitative measurement of volatility clustering

As mentioned above, in order to discuss the volatility clustering in a more
quantitative way, it is better to introduce some parameters to quantitatively
measure the volatility clustering of diﬀerent ﬁnancial time series that we

2Our swapping procedure is described as follows. We ﬁrst swap the largest ﬂuctuation
(whether they are positive or negative) with the smallest one in the time series and then
the second largest ﬂuctuation with the second smallest one, and so on, until the required
percentage is achieved.

can make comparison with. We here introduce an index to quantify the
volatility clustering in the ﬁnancial time series. We begin by introducing
a moving window with a certain window size to scan through a given time
series. As an example, one can pick a window with size of n (where n is ﬁxed
throughout the scanning process) trading days. Similar to what we have
done in the previous section, we can count the total number of trading days
that are among the largest p% ﬂuctuations in returns within this window as
we scan through the time series. As we will see, one can interpret this as the
degree of volatility clustering of the largest p% ﬂuctuations with respect to
this particular window with size n.

Figure 7 is an illustration of the clustering of the largest 20% ﬂuctuations
in ﬁgure 1 with a window size of 10 trading days, a span of two weeks in
real daily life. The statistics here is obtained by using the so called moving
window method. This means that we begin by putting the window on the
ﬁrst day of the whole series and count the number of days among largest
20% ﬂuctuations within this 10-day window. This is the ﬁrst step. We then
move on to the second day of the whole series and again count the number
of days among largest 20% ﬂuctuations within this next 10-day window, the
second step. We repeat the same procedure until we ﬁnish scanning through
the whole time series. The curve with full circles in ﬁgure 7 is a plot of the
frequency distribution of the number of days among the largest 20% ﬂuctua-
tions within a 10-day period by using this moving window method. To make

11

it into a quantitative measure of the degree of clustering, we need to compare
it with a randomly generated time series for example, a Gaussian noise series.
The curve with open circles in ﬁgure 7 is the frequency distribution of the
number of days of the largest 20% ﬂuctuations within a 10-day period from
a simulated Gaussian noise series. From ﬁgure 7, one can already visually
tell the diﬀerence between these two curves. To be more concise, we take the
ratio of the standard deviation of the number of days of the largest p% ﬂuc-
tuations within the n-day window between the empirical and the simulated
data sets. Mathematically, it is deﬁned as Rn ≡ σe/σG, where σe and σG are
the standard deviation of the number of days of the largest p% ﬂuctuations
within an n-day period for the empirical and simulated Gaussian data sets
respectively. The larger the ratio is, the larger the degree of clustering will
be. This result can be understood easily. The average number of days of
largest p% ﬂuctuations within a window size of n is equal to p× n/100. This
is true irrespective of whether it is the empirical data set or the simulated
one. One can indeed see this for the simulated data set which has a peak
near this value. However, if the time series displays the phenomenon of clus-
tering of large ﬂuctuations, there will be a higher frequency of occurrence
that the number of days of the largest p% ﬂuctuations within this window
is much larger than the average value p × n/100. Similarly, there will also
be a higher frequency of occurrence that the number of days of the largest
p% ﬂuctuations within this window is much smaller than the average value
p× n/100. This scenario will indeed be reﬂected in the value of the standard
deviation of the frequency distribution in ﬁgure 7. Thus, one can simply take
the ratio of the standard deviation of the empirical and simulated data sets
to get a quantitative measure of the degree of clustering of the largest p%
ﬂuctuations of the ﬁnancial time series that one is interested in.

The ratio or index Rn that we introduce here can in fact be studied
analytically. It has both theoretical upper and lower bounds and the standard
deviation of the simulated Gaussian noise can also be calculated analytically.
Let us ﬁrst derive the theoretical value of the standard deviation of the
simulated Gaussian noise. Recall from above that the mean value of the
average number of days of the largest p% ﬂuctuations within a n-day window
is equal to p × n/100. For a total of n days, the probability that there are m
days with ﬂuctuations among the largest p% ﬂuctuations can be written as,

n!

m!(n − m)!

P m(1 − P )n−m ,

12

(3)

where P denotes p/100. We here convert the percentage into decimals for
simplicity. The standard deviation of the average number of days of the
largest p% ﬂuctuations within a n-day window is therefore equal to

(m − P n)2P m(1 − P )n−m#1/2
σG =" n
Xm=0

=pnP (1 − P ) ,

(4)

which is the familiar result in statistics for the standard deviation of a se-
quence of n random events with occurrence probability P . The theoretical
lower bound for the index corresponds to the case when the time series is
completely random, which is therefore equal to 1.

To get a theoretical upper limit of the standard deviation of the average
number of days of the largest p% ﬂuctuations within a n-day period, we
proceed as follows. We look for the extreme case when all the largest p%
ﬂuctuations are ordered one after the other, then followed by the rest of the
data points (one can of course reverse the order of the largest p% ﬂuctuations
and the rest). The ﬁrst p% of the data points will then be represented by 1
and the rest will be by 0, as what we have done in the above. This is the
case when we should have the largest possible degree of clustering. If one
plots this extreme case in ﬁgure 7, one will have two peaks in the frequency
distribution function, one is at 0, and the other is at n (10 in the case in
ﬁgure 7). Let us now use a window of size n and begin with the ﬁrst data
point, which is a 1, and count the n data points in this window, all of which
are 1s (assuming that the length of the time series N is much longer than
the window size n). Recall that we call this procedure to be step one. We
then let the window slide to the next data point, the second step, and so on.
As the moving window continues to move along the time series, it will have
moved P N − n + 1 steps before it reaches the ﬁrst 0. We again have P here
to be equal to p/100 for simplicity. As it continues to move along the time
series, the number of 1s will decrease while the number of 0s will increase
until the window consists of all 0s. There are then (1 − P )N − n + 1 steps
which has all 0s within the moving window. For the whole time series, we
have a total of N − n + 1 steps so we have to average over these steps. It
is now easy to calculate the standard deviation in this extreme case, which
is the square root of the expression in Eq. (5). Recall that the average 1s
within the moving window is P n. We then have

Figure 8 shows the value of the clustering index for NASDAQ time series
in ﬁgure 1 for various largest p% ﬂuctuations as a function of window size n.
The diﬀerent curves represent the diﬀerent largest p% of the ﬂuctuations in
the time series. We have included here the results for p = 5, 10, 15 and 20.
Also included is the curve of the theoretical limit of the index. The index
values all start from unity when the window size n corresponds to 1 trading
day, and gradually increase as the window size increases.

With the clustering index in hand, one can practically study the behaviour
of clustering of any sort of ﬂuctuations in a ﬁnancial time series. Other than
the largest p% that we have looked into, one can also look at the degree of

14

clustering for small ﬂuctuations. To give the reader an idea of how one can
use the index to study the properties of ﬁnancial time series, we go back to
a case which we considered in previous section. Recall that we have studied
a time series in which we swapped the largest p% and smallest p% of the
returns in the series, as indicated in ﬁgure 6. It turns out that the nonlinear
autocorrelation function of the swapped data set still exhibits similar slow
decay behaviour. On the other hand, we have analyzed the other six time
series that we consider in this paper and there is practically no such kind
of slow decay behaviour of the swapped data sets. Using the index that we
introduce here, the diﬀerence becomes clear. Figure 9 shows the curves for
the index value of the smallest 20% returns vs. window size in all the seven
ﬁnancial time series that we study in this work. One can now see that the
value of the index is rather small for each of the other six ﬁnancial time series
when compared with the curve for USD/NTD. This means that the clustering
of the smallest 20% returns of these other ﬁnancial time series indeed behave
not much diﬀerent from random sequences. On the other hand, the clustering
of the time series USD/NTD as shown in ﬁgure 6 is signiﬁcantly larger which
in turn reﬂects the slow decay behaviour of the swapped data set in ﬁgure 6.
A possible explanation for the anomaly of clustering behaviour shown in
the USD/NTD time series might be a result from the stronger interference
of Taiwan Central Bank than other countries. Since Taiwan is an export-
oriented country, the government will attempt to regulate more frequently
the ﬂuctuations in the daily closing value of USD/NTD. Whether this is the
main reason for such an anomaly is not clear to us for the moment. The
above example thus suggests that the index that we introduce here is a good
indicator to quantify the degree of clustering of ﬂuctuations in ﬁnancial time
series.
In the next section, we will see that the index that we introduce
here indeed contains more information than people have previous observed
in ﬁnancial time series.

4. Rise/Fall asymmetry

There exists discussions in the literature [20, 21, 22, 23] about the asym-
metry of asset returns such as the skewness of the returns distribution in
ﬁgure 2.
In the study of ﬁnancial time series, one can for example, ask
whether there are more days that the returns are gains (rises) rather than
losses (falls) as some kind of asymmetry. One can further ask whether the
returns in gains would like to cluster more or the other way round, how large

drawn as a thick line for comparison.

the diﬀerence is, and whether large ﬂuctuations tend to cluster more, etc.
These can all be viewed as asymmetries in a ﬁnancial time series. With the
index introduced in previous section, one should hopefully be able to extract
more information on the asymmetries in ﬁnancial time series and to study
these asymmetries on a more quantitative basis. To study the asymmetries
in ﬁnancial time series, let us ﬁrst give the deﬁnitions here. In the case of the
asymmetry between the largest/smallest returns, we adopt the notation that
the largest and smallest ﬂuctuations refer to the absolute returns as before.
We ﬁrst obtain the clustering index for the largest and smallest p% returns.
The asymmetry of largest/smallest returns Als is then deﬁned as

Als =

Rl − Rs
Rl + Rs

,

(8)

where Rl and Rs are the indices for the largest and smallest p% ﬂuctuations
respectively. This asymmetry will give us an idea whether the large ﬂuctua-
tions or the small ﬂuctuations would like to cluster more as we increase the
size of the moving window. From this deﬁnition, it is clear that Als is equal
to zero when the window size is equal to 1, since there are an equal number
of largest and smallest ﬂuctuations.

In a similar fashion, one can deﬁne the asymmetry between the largest

16

positive and negative returns, which we call A+− as follows

A+− =

R+ − R−
R+ + R−

,

(9)

where R+ and R− are the indices for the largest positive and negative returns
respectively. We should remind our reader here that in the case of A+−, we
ﬁrst pick up the largest p% ﬂuctuations from the absolute returns and then
separate the ﬂuctuations (returns) into positive and negative categories. In
this way, we can see the asymmetry between the large positive and negative
returns as well as their degree of clustering. Notice that the asymmetries as
deﬁned above are bounded by 1 and -1. Figure 10 contains the plots of the
asymmetries Als and A+− for p = 15 and 20 for the NASDAQ time series
in ﬁgure 1. From the ﬁgure, it is easy to observe that the two curves for
Als are always positive, which means that the degree of clustering is more
obvious for large ﬂuctuations than for small ﬂuctuations in the NASDAQ
times series. On the other hand, the two curves for A+− are always below
zero. This reﬂects the fact that negative returns, or big losses are likely to
cluster together than big gains in the case of NASDAQ. This is in agreement
with some observations [2, 22] indicating that there are more big losses rather
than big gains in ﬁnancial markets since we have more big losses and these
big losses are more likely to lump together. We should remark here that
the window size equals to 1 corresponds to the asymmetry of distribution
of returns in ﬁgure 2. In the case of NASDAQ, the asymmetry is negative.
There are however, examples of ﬁnancial time series that the asymmetry
for the probability density function is positive and they are included in the
appendix below. By increasing the size of the moving window, one can also
study the asymmetry of returns with respect to the clustering of large and
small ﬂuctuations. Therefore, the use of the index to study asymmetries in
ﬁnancial time series allows one to extract more information comparing to
conventional methods.

The asymmetry between rises (gains) and falls (losses) in returns can also
be observed in the probability of the occurrence of large and small ﬂuctu-
ations following the occurrence of large or small ones on the previous day,
which is shown in table 2. Unlike table 1, we now separate the rise and fall
of the ﬂuctuations into separate categories. Each row in this table sums to
unity as before. In this way, one can easily detect the diﬀerence.

5. Summary and discussion

In this paper, we have made a detailed analysis of the stylized facts in
ﬁnancial time series. We have found that the slow decay behaviour is di-
rectly related to the degree of clustering of the large ﬂuctuations (absolute
returns) within the ﬁnancial time series while the heavy tails in return dis-
tributions do not seem to play a role here. We have also introduced an index
to quantitatively measure the clustering behaviour of ﬂuctuations in ﬁnan-
cial time series and have given examples to demonstrate its advantages over
the conventional methods. This index has both theoretical lower and upper
bounds. It is equal to unity if the ﬂuctuations are independent, identically
distributed within the ﬁnancial time series. On the other hand, its upper
bound can also be analytically calculated and in the limit when the time
scale of the given series is much longer than the window size n, the index
Rn is simply equal to √n. With this index in hand, one not only can study
the asymmetry of the asset returns but also the eﬀect of clustering on the
asymmetry properties in ﬁnancial time series. One can see that the larger
ﬂuctuations tend to cluster more than the smaller ones. Similarly, big losses
tend to lump together more severely than big gains. These ﬁndings should
be helpful to people who make investments in ﬁnancial markets.
Indeed,
the clustering index introduced might also be employed to investigate the
clustering behaviour of other nonlinear systems.

Whether the clustering of large ﬂuctuations in ﬁnancial time series is from
long time memory eﬀect or other eﬀects such as human psychology is not clear
to us at the moment. Indeed, if only the clustering of large ﬂuctuations is
concerned, one is able to ﬁnd complex systems that are random in nature but
can possess the property of large degree of clustering. It is also possible to ﬁnd
simple ways which can give both large degrees of clustering and slow-decaying
nonlinear autocorrelations in a simulated time series. We will discuss these
issues in a future publication [24].
