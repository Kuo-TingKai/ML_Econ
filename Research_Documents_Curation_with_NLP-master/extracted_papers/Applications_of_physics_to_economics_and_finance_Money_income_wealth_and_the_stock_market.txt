APPLICATIONS OF PHYSICS TO ECONOMICS AND FINANCE:

MONEY, INCOME, WEALTH, AND THE STOCK MARKET ∗

Department of Physics, University of Maryland, College Park

Adrian A. Dr˘agulescu†

(Dated: May 15, 2002, cond-mat/0307341)

Abstract: Several problems arising in Economics and Finance are analyzed using concepts and quantitative

methods from Physics. The disertation is organized as follows:

In the ﬁrst chapter, it is argued that in a closed economic system, money is conserved. Thus, by analogy
with energy, the equilibrium probability distribution of money must follow the exponential Boltzmann-Gibbs
law characterized by an effective temperature equal to the average amount of money per economic agent. The
emergence of Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution is demonstrated through computer simulations of economic mod-
els. A thermal machine which extracts a monetary proﬁt can be constructed between two economic systems
with different temperatures. The role of debt and models with broken time-reversal symmetry for which the
Boltzmann-Gibbs law does not hold, are discussed.

In the second chapter, using data from several sources, it is found that the distribution of income is described
for the great majority of population by an exponential distribution, whereas the high-end tail follows a power
law. From the individual income distribution, the probability distribution of income for families with two earners
is derived and it is shown that it also agrees well with the data. Data on wealth is presentend and it is found
that the distribution of wealth has a structure similar to the distribution of income. The Lorenz curve and Gini
coefﬁcient were calculated and are shown to be in good agreement with both income and wealth data sets.

In the third chapter, the stock-market ﬂuctuations at different time scales are investigated. A model where
stock-price dynamics is governed by a geometrical (multiplicative) Brownian motion with stochastic variance
is proposed. The corresponding Fokker-Planck equation can be solved exactly. Integrating out the variance, an
analytic formula for the time-dependent probability distribution of stock price changes (returns) is found. The
formula is in excellent agreement with the Dow-Jones index for the time lags from 1 to 250 trading days. For
time lags longer than the relaxation time of variance, the probability distribution can be expressed in a scaling
form using a Bessel function. The Dow-Jones data follow the scaling function for seven orders of magnitude.

equilibrium physics, and also through personal interaction for
more than three years. I had proﬁted a lot from the association

All the people mentioned above have generously shared
with me some of their time and knowledge. I will do all I
can to represent them well.

money5 reﬂects their fundamental property that, unlike mate-
rial wealth, money (more precisely the ﬁat, “paper” money) is
not allowed to be manufactured by regular economic agents,
but can only be transferred between agents. Our approach
here is very similar to that of Ispolatov et al.6. However, they
considered only models with broken time-reversal symmetry,
for which the Boltzmann-Gibbs law typically does not hold.
The role of time-reversal symmetry and deviations from the
Boltzmann-Gibbs law are discussed in detail in Sec. I G.

It is tempting to identify the money distribution P (m) with
the distribution of wealth6. However, money is only one part
of wealth, the other part being material wealth. Material prod-
ucts have no conservation law because they can be manu-
factured, destroyed, consumed, etc. Moreover, the monetary
value of a material product (the price) is not constant. The
same applies to stocks, which economics textbooks explicitly
exclude from the deﬁnition of money7. So, we do not ex-
pect the Boltzmann-Gibbs law for the distribution of wealth.
Some authors believe that wealth is distributed according to a
power law (Pareto-Zipf), which originates from a multiplica-
tive random process8. Such a process may reﬂect, among
other things, the ﬂuctuations of prices needed to evaluate the
monetary value of material wealth.

I. STATISTICAL MECHANICS OF MONEY

B. Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution

A.

Introduction

The application of statistical physics methods to economics
promises fresh insights into problems traditionally not asso-
ciated with physics (see, for example, the recent review and
book1). Both statistical mechanics and economics study big
ensembles: collections of atoms or economic agents, respec-
tively. The fundamental law of equilibrium statistical mechan-
ics is the Boltzmann-Gibbs law, which states that the proba-
bility distribution of energy ε is P (ε) = Ce−ε/T , where T is
the temperature, and C is a normalizing constant2. The main
ingredient that is essential for the textbook derivation of the
Boltzmann-Gibbs law2 is the conservation of energy3. Thus,
one may generalize that any conserved quantity in a big sta-
tistical system should have an exponential probability distri-
bution in equilibrium.

An example of such an unconventional Boltzmann-Gibbs
law is the probability distribution of forces experienced by
the beads in a cylinder pressed with an external force4. Be-
cause the system is at rest, the total force along the cylinder
axis experienced by each layer of granules is constant and is
randomly distributed among the individual beads. Thus the
conditions are satisﬁed for the applicability of the Boltzmann-
Gibbs law to the force, rather than energy, and it was indeed
found experimentally4.

We claim that,

in a closed economic system,

the to-
tal amount of money is conserved. Thus the equilibrium
probability distribution of money P (m) should follow the
Boltzmann-Gibbs law P (m) = Ce−m/T . Here m is money,
and T is an effective temperature equal to the average amount
of money per economic agent. The conservation law of

Let us consider a system of many economic agents N ≫ 1,
which may be individuals or corporations. In this thesis, we
only consider the case where their number is constant. Each
agent i has some money mi and may exchange it with other
agents. It is implied that money is used for some economic
activity, such as buying or selling material products; however,
we are not interested in that aspect. As in Ref.6, for us the
only result of interaction between agents i and j is that some
money ∆m changes hands: [mi, mj] → [m′i, m′j] = [mi −
∆m, mj + ∆m]. Notice that the total amount of money is
conserved in each transaction: mi+mj = m′i+m′j. This local
conservation law of money5 is analogous to the conservation
of energy in collisions between atoms. We assume that the
economic system is closed, i. e. there is no external ﬂux of
money, thus the total amount of money M in the system is
conserved. Also, in the ﬁrst part of this chapter, we do not
permit any debt, so each agent’s money must be non-negative:
mi ≥ 0. A similar condition applies to the kinetic energy of
atoms: εi ≥ 0.
Let us introduce the probability distribution function of
money P (m), which is deﬁned so that the number of agents
with money between m and m + dm is equal to N P (m) dm.
We are interested in the stationary distribution P (m) corre-
sponding to the state of thermodynamic equilibrium. In this
state, an individual agent’s money mi strongly ﬂuctuates, but
the overall probability distribution P (m) does not change.

The equilibrium distribution function P (m) can be derived
in the same manner as the equilibrium distribution function
of energy P (ε) in physics2. Let us divide the system into
two subsystems 1 and 2. Taking into account that money
is conserved and additive: m = m1 + m2, whereas the

than indicated, so it actually ends at the time 106.

probability is multiplicative: P = P1P2, we conclude that
P (m1 + m2) = P (m1)P (m2). The solution of this equa-
tion is P (m) = Ce−m/T ; thus the equilibrium probabil-
ity distribution of money has the Boltzmann-Gibbs form.
0 P (m) dm = 1 and
0 m P (m) dm = M/N , we ﬁnd that C = 1/T and
T = M/N . Thus, the effective temperature T is the aver-
age amount of money per agent.

The Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution can be also derived by
distribution
S = −R ∞
0 dm P (m) ln P (m) under the constraint of mon-
ey conservation2. Following original Boltzmann’s argument,
let us divide the money axis 0 ≤ m ≤ ∞ into small bins of
size dm and number the bins consecutively with the index b =
1, 2, . . . Let us denote the number of agents in a bin b as Nb,
the total number being N =P∞b=1 Nb. The agents in the bin
b have money mb, and the total money is M =P∞b=1 mbNb.
The probability of realization of a certain set of occupation
numbers{Nb} is proportional to the number of ways N agents
can be distributed among the bins preserving the set {Nb}.
This number is N !/N1!N2! . . . The logarithm of probability
is entropy ln N ! −P∞b=1 ln Nb!. When the numbers Nb are
big and Stirling’s formula ln N ! ≈ N ln N − N applies, the
entropy per agent is S = (N ln N −P∞b=1 Nb ln Nb)/N =
−P∞b=1 Pb ln Pb, where Pb = Nb/N is the probability that an
agent has money mb. Using the method of Lagrange multipli-
ers to maximize the entropy S with respect to the occupation
numbers {Nb} with the constraints on the total money M and
the total number of agents N generates the Boltzmann-Gibbs
distribution for P (m)2.

C. Computer simulations

To check that these general arguments indeed work, we per-
formed several computer simulations. Initially, all agents are
given the same amount of money: P (m) = δ(m − M/N ),
which is shown in Fig. 1 as the double vertical line. One pair
of agents at a time is chosen randomly, then one of the agents
is randomly picked to be the “winner” (the other agent be-
comes the “loser”), and the amount ∆m ≥ 0 is transferred
from the loser to the winner. If the loser does not have enough
money to pay (mi < ∆m), then the transaction does not take
place, and we proceed to another pair of agents. Thus, the
agents are not permitted to have negative money. This bound-
ary condition is crucial in establishing the stationary distribu-
tion. As the agents exchange money, the initial delta-function
distribution ﬁrst spreads symmetrically. Then, the probability
density starts to pile up at the impenetrable boundary m = 0.
The distribution becomes asymmetric (skewed) and ultimately
reaches the stationary exponential shape shown in Fig. 1. We
used several trading rules in the simulations: the exchange of
a small constant amount ∆m = 1, the exchange of a ran-
dom fraction 0 ≤ ν ≤ 1 of the average money of the pair:
∆m = ν(mi + mj)/2, and the exchange of a random fraction
ν of the average money in the system: ∆m = ν M/N . Fig-
ures in this chapter mostly show simulations for the third rule;
however, the ﬁnal stationary distribution was found to be the
same for all rules.

In the process of evolution, the entropy S of the system
increases in time and saturates at the maximal value for the
BoltzmannGibbs distribution. This is illustrated by the top
curve in Fig. 2 computed for the third rule of exchange. The
bottom curve in Fig. 2 shows the time evolution of entropy
for the ﬁrst rule of exchange. The time scale for this curve is
500 times greater than for the top curve, so the bottom curve

actually ends at the time 106. The plot shows that, for the ﬁrst
rule of exchange, mixing is much slower than for the third one.
Nevertheless, even for the ﬁrst rule, the system also eventually
reaches the Boltzmann-Gibbs state of maximal entropy, albeit
over a time much longer than shown in Fig. 2.

One might argue that the pairwise exchange of money may
correspond to a medieval market, but not to a modern econ-
omy. In order to make the model somewhat more realistic,
we introduce ﬁrms. One agent at a time becomes a “ﬁrm”.
The ﬁrm borrows capital K from another agent and returns it
with an interest rK, hires L agents and pays them wages W ,
manufactures Q items of a product and sells it to Q agents
at a price R. All of these agents are randomly selected. The
ﬁrm receives the proﬁt F = RQ − LW − rK. The net re-
sult is a many-body exchange of money that still satisﬁes the
conservation law.

Parameters of the model are selected following the pro-
cedure described in economics textbooks7. The aggregate
demand-supply curve for the product is taken to be R(Q) =
V /Qη, where Q is the quantity people would buy at a price
R, and η = 0.5 and V = 100 are constants. The produc-
tion function of the ﬁrm has the conventional Cobb-Douglas
form: Q(L, K) = LβK 1−β, where β = 0.8 is a constant. In
our simulation, we set W = 10. By maximizing ﬁrm’s proﬁt
F with respect to K and L, we ﬁnd the values of the other
parameters: L = 20, Q = 10, R = 32, and F = 68.

However, the actual values of the parameters do not matter.
Our computer simulations show that the stationary probability
distribution of money in this model always has the universal
Boltzmann-Gibbs form independent of the model parameters.

D. Thermal machine

As explained in the Introduction, the money distribution
P (m) should not be confused with the distribution of wealth.
We believe that P (m) should be interpreted as the instanta-
neous distribution of purchasing power in the system. Indeed,
to make a purchase, one needs money. Material wealth nor-
mally is not used directly for a purchase. It needs to be sold
ﬁrst to be converted into money.

Let us consider an outside monopolistic vendor selling a
product (say, cars) to the system of agents at a price p. Sup-
pose that a certain small fraction f of the agents needs to buy
the product at a given time, and each agent who has enough
money to afford the price will buy one item. The fraction f
is assumed to be sufﬁciently small, so that the purchase does
not perturb the whole system signiﬁcantly. At the same time,
the absolute number of agents in this group is assumed to be
big enough to make the group statistically representative and
characterized by the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution of money.
The agents in this group continue to exchange money with the
rest of the system, which acts as a thermal bath. The demand
for the product is constantly renewed, because products pur-
chased in the past expire after a certain time. In this situation,
the vendor can sell the product persistently, thus creating a
small steady leakage of money from the system to the vendor.
What price p would maximize the vendor’s income?

4

it

is convenient

this question,

To answer
to introduce
the cumulative distribution of purchasing power N (m) =
NR ∞
m P (m′) dm′ = N e−m/T , which gives the number of
agents whose money is greater than m. The vendor’s income
is f pN (p). It is maximal when p = T , i. e. the optimal price
is equal to the temperature of the system. This conclusion
also follows from the simple dimensional argument that tem-
perature is the only money scale in the problem. At the price
p = T that maximizes the vendor’s income, only the fraction
N (T )/N = e−1 = 0.37 of the agents can afford to buy the
product.
Now let us consider two disconnected economic systems,
one with the temperature T1 and another with T2: T1 > T2.
A vendor can buy a product in the latter system at its equi-
librium price T2 and sell it in the former system at the price
T1, thus extracting the speculative proﬁt T1 − T2, as in a ther-
mal machine. This example suggests that speculative proﬁt
is possible only when the system as a whole is out of equi-
librium. As money is transferred from the high- to the low-
temperature system, their temperatures become closer and
eventually equal. After that, no speculative proﬁt is possi-
ble, which would correspond to the “thermal death” of the
economy. This example brings to mind economic relations
between developed and developing countries, with manufac-
turing in the poor (low-temperature) countries for export to
the rich (high-temperature) ones.

We will demonstrate in Ch. II that for the large majority
of the population the distribution of income is exponential.
Hence, similar to the distribution of money, the distribution
of income has a corresponding temperature. If in the previ-
ous discussion about economic trade, the two countries have a
different temperature for the distribution of income, the pos-
sibility of constructing a thermal machine will still hold true.
This is because purchasing power (total money) per unit time
has two components: a positive one, income and a negative
one, spending. Instead of making a one time purchase, the
buyer will buy one product per unit time, effectively creating
the thermal engine. We will revisit this idea in Sec. II E when
we give the values for income temperature between the states
of the USA and for the United Kingdom.

E. Models with debt

Now let us discuss what happens if the agents are permit-
ted to go into debt. Debt can be viewed as negative money.
Now when a loser does not have enough money to pay, he
can borrow the required amount from a reservoir, and his
balance becomes negative. The conservation law is not vi-
olated: The sum of the winner’s positive money and loser’s
negative money remains constant. When an agent with a
negative balance receives money as a winner, she uses this
money to repay the debt until her balance becomes positive.
We assume for simplicity that the reservoir charges no inter-
est for the lent money. However, because it is not sensible
to permit unlimited debt, we put a limit md on the maximal
debt of an agent: mi > −md. This new boundary condi-
tion P (m < −md) = 0 replaces the old boundary condition

P (m < 0) = 0. The result of a computer simulation with
md = 800 is shown in Fig. 3 together with the curve for md =

with the higher temperature T = M/N + md, because the
normalization conditions need to be maintained including the
P (m) dm = 1 and
m P (m) dm = M/N . The higher temperature makes

the money distribution broader, which means that debt in-

In general, temperature is completely determined by the av-
erage money per agent, hmi = M/N , and the boundary con-
ditions. Suppose the agents are required to have no less money
than m1 and no more than m2: m1 ≤ m ≤ m2. In this case,

tributions, the number of events becomes small and statistics
poor, so the Boltzmann-Gibbs law loses applicability. Thus,
we expect the Boltzmann-Gibbs law to hold only for the in-
termediate range of money not too close either to the lower
boundary or to the very high end. However, this range is the
most relevant, because it covers the great majority of popula-
tion.

Lending creates equal amounts of positive (asset) and neg-
ative (liability) money5,7. When economics textbooks de-
scribe how “banks create money” or “debt creates money”7,
they do not count the negative liabilities as money, and thus
their money is not conserved. In our operational deﬁnition of
money, we include all ﬁnancial instruments with ﬁxed denom-
ination, such as currency, IOUs, and bonds, but not material
wealth or stocks, and we count both assets and liabilities. With
this deﬁnition, money is conserved, and we expect to see the
Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution in equilibrium. Unfortunately,
because this deﬁnition differs from economists’ deﬁnitions of
money (M1, M2, M3, etc.7), it is not easy to ﬁnd the appro-
priate statistics. Of course, money can be also emitted by a
central bank or government. This is analogous to an external
inﬂux of energy into a physical system. However, if this pro-
cess is sufﬁciently slow, the economic system may be able to
maintain quasi-equilibrium, characterized by a slowly chang-
ing temperature.

We performed a simulation of a model with one bank and
many agents. The agents keep their money in accounts on
which the bank pays interest. The agents may borrow money
from the bank, for which they must pay interest in monthly
installments. If they cannot make the required payments, they
may be declared bankrupt, which relieves them from the debt,
but the liability is transferred to the bank. In this way, the con-
servation of money is maintained. The model is too elaborate
to describe it in full detail here. We found that, depending on
the parameters of the model, either the agents constantly lose
money to the bank, which steadily reduces the agents’ temper-
ature, or the bank constantly loses money, which drives down
its own negative balance and steadily increases the agents’
temperature.

where m = (m1+m2)/2 and ∆m = (m2−m1)/2. It follows
from Eq. (1) that the temperature is positive when m > hmi,
negative when m < hmi, and inﬁnite (P (m) = const) when
m = hmi. In particular, if agents’ money are bounded from
above, but not from below: −∞ ≤ m ≤ m2, the temper-
ature is negative. That means an inverted Boltzmann-Gibbs
distribution with more rich agents than poor.

Imposing a sharp cutoff at md may be not quite realistic.
In practice, the cutoff may be extended over some range de-
pending on the exact bankruptcy rules. Over this range, the
Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution would be smeared out. So we
expect to see the Boltzmann-Gibbs law only sufﬁciently far
from the cutoff region. Similarly, in experiment4, some devi-
ations from the exponential law were observed near the lower
boundary of the distribution. Also, at the high end of the dis-

The Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution can be also derived from
the Boltzmann equation9, which describes the time evolution
of the distribution function P (m) due to pairwise interactions:

Here w[m,m′]→[m−∆,m′+∆] is the rate of transferring money
∆ from an agent with money m to an agent with money m′.
If a model has time-reversal symmetry, then the transition rate
of a direct process is the same as the transition rate of the re-
versed process, thus the w-factors in the ﬁrst and second lines
of Eq. (2) are equal. In this case, it can be easily checked that
the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution P (m) = C exp(−m/T )

nulliﬁes the right-hand side of Eq. (2); thus this distribution
is stationary: dP (m)/dt = 09.

G. Non-Boltzmann-Gibbs distributions

However, if time-reversal symmetry is broken, the two tran-
sition rates w in Eq. (2) may be different, and the system may
have a non-Boltzmann-Gibbs stationary distribution or no sta-
tionary distribution at all. Examples of this kind were stud-
ied in Ref.6. One model was called multiplicative random
exchange. In this model, a randomly selected loser i loses
a ﬁxed fraction α of his money mi to a randomly selected
winner j: [mi, mj] → [(1 − α)mi , mj + αmi]. If we try
to reverse this process and immediately appoint the winner
j to become a loser, the system does not return to the orig-
inal conﬁguration [mi, mj]:
[(1 − α)mi , mj + αmi] →
[(1 − α)mi + α(mj + αmi) , (1 − α)(mj + αmi)]. Ex-
cept for α = 1/2, the exponential distribution function is not
a stationary solution of the Boltzmann equation derived for
this model in Ref.6. Instead, the stationary distribution has the
shape shown in Fig. 4 for α = 1/3, which we reproduced in
our numerical simulations. It still has an exponential tail end
at the high end, but drops to zero at the low end for α < 1/2.
Another example of similar kind was studied in Ref.10, which
appeared after the ﬁrst version of our paper was posted as
cond-mat/0001432 on January 30, 2000. In that model, the
agents save a fraction λ of their money and exchange a ran-
dom fraction ǫ of their total remaining money: [mi, mj] →
[λmi + ǫ(1− λ)(mi + mj) , λmj + (1− ǫ)(1− λ)(mi + mj)].
This exchange also does not return to the original conﬁgura-
tion after being reversed. The stationary probability distribu-
tion was found in Ref.10 to be nonexponential for λ 6= 0 with
a shape qualitatively similar to the one shown in Fig. 4.
Another interesting example which has a non-Boltzmann-

Gibbs distribution occurs in a model with taxes and subsi-
dies. Suppose a special agent (“government”) collects a frac-
tion (“tax”) of every transaction in the system. The collected
money is then equally divided among all agents of the sys-
tem, so that each agent receives the subsidy δm with the fre-
quency 1/τs. Assuming that δm is small and approximating
9, we obtain the
the collision integral with a relaxation time τr
following Boltzmann equation

∂P (m)

∂m

= −

P (m) − ˜P (m)

,

(3)

where ˜P (m) is the equilibrium Boltzmann-Gibbs function.
The second term in the left-hand side of Eq. (3) is analo-
gous to the force applied to electrons in a metal by an ex-
ternal electric ﬁeld9. The approximate stationary solution
of Eq. (3) is the displaced Boltzmann-Gibbs one: P (m) =
˜P (m−(τr/τs) δm). The displacement of the equilibrium dis-
tribution ˜P (m) by (τr/τs) δm would leave an empty gap near
m = 0. This gap is ﬁlled by interpolating between zero pop-
ulation at m = 0 and the displaced distribution. The curve
obtained in a computer simulation of this model (Fig. 5) qual-
itatively agrees with this expectation. The low-money popula-
tion is suppressed, because the government, acting as an exter-
nal force, “pumps out” that population and pushes the system
out of thermodynamic equilibrium. We found that the entropy
of the stationary state in the model with taxes and subsidies is
few a percent lower than without.

These examples show that the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribu-
tion is not fully universal, meaning that it does not hold for
just any model of exchange that conserves money. Neverthe-
less, it is universal in a limited sense: For a broad class of
models that have time-reversal symmetry, the stationary dis-
tribution is exponential and does not depend on the details of
a model. Conversely, when time-reversal symmetry is bro-
ken, the distribution may depend on model details. The dif-

ference between these two classes of models may be rather
subtle. For example, let us change the multiplicative random
exchange from a ﬁxed fraction of loser’s money to a ﬁxed
fraction of the total money of winner and loser. This mod-
iﬁcation retains the multiplicative idea that the amount ex-
changed is proportional to the amount involved, but restores
time-reversal symmetry and the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribu-
tion. In the model with ∆m = 1 discussed in the next Section,
the difference between time-reversible and time-irreversible
formulations amounts to the difference between impenetra-
ble and absorbing boundary conditions at m = 0. Unlike in
physics, in economy there is no fundamental requirement that
interactions have time-reversal symmetry. However, in the ab-
sence of detailed knowledge of real microscopic dynamics of
economic exchange, the semiuniversal Boltzmann-Gibbs dis-
tribution appears to be a natural starting point.

Moreover, deviations from the Boltzmann-Gibbs law may
occur only if the transition rates w in Eq. (2) explicitly de-
pend on the agents’ money m or m′ in an asymmetric man-
ner. In another simulation, we randomly preselected winners
and losers for every pair of agents (i, j). In this case, money
ﬂows along directed links between the agents: i → j → k,
and time-reversal symmetry is strongly broken. This model
is closer to the real economy, in which, for example, one
typically receives money from an employer and pays it to a
grocer, but rarely the reverse. Nevertheless, we still found
the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution of money in this model, be-
cause the transition rates w do not explicitly depend on m and
m′.

H. Nonlinear Boltzmann equation vs. linear master equation

For the model where agents randomly exchange the con-

stant amount ∆m = 1, the Boltzmann equation is:

dPm
dt

= Pm+1

Pn + Pm−1

− Pm

Pn − Pm

(5)

= (Pm+1 + Pm−1 − 2Pm) + P0(Pm − Pm−1),

where Pm ≡ P (m) and we have usedP∞m=0 Pm = 1. The
ﬁrst, diffusion term in Eq. (5) is responsible for broadening of
the initial delta-function distribution. The second term, pro-
portional to P0, is essential for the Boltzmann-Gibbs distri-
bution Pm = e−m/T (1 − e−1/T ) to be a stationary solution
In a similar model studied in Ref.6, the second
of Eq. (5).
term was omitted on the assumption that agents who lost all
money are eliminated: P0 = 0. In that case, the total number
of agents is not conserved, and the system never reaches any
stationary distribution. Time-reversal symmetry is violated,
since transitions into the state m = 0 are permitted, but not
out of this state.

If we treat P0 as a constant, Eq. (5) looks like a linear
Fokker-Planck equation9 for Pm, with the ﬁrst term describing
diffusion and the second term an external force proportional

7

to P0. Similar equations were studied in Ref.8. Eq. (5) can be
also rewritten as

dPm
dt

= Pm+1 − (2 − P0)Pm + (1 − P0)Pm−1.

(6)

The coefﬁcient (1−P0) in front of Pm−1 represents the rate of
increasing money by ∆m = 1, and the coefﬁcient 1 in front of
Pm+1 represents the rate of decreasing money by ∆m = −1.
Since P0 > 0, the former is smaller than the latter, which
results in the stationary Boltzmann-Gibbs distributions Pm =
(1− P0)m. An equation similar to Eq. (6) describes a Markov
chain studied for strategic market games in Ref.11. Naturally,
the stationary probability distribution of wealth in that model
was found to be exponential11.

Even though Eqs. (5) and (6) look like linear equations,
nevertheless the Boltzmann equation (2) and (4) is a pro-
foundly nonlinear equation.
It contains the product of two
probability distribution functions P in the right-hand side, be-
cause two agents are involved in money exchange. Most stud-
ies of wealth distribution8 have the fundamental ﬂaw that they
use a single-particle approach. They assume that the wealth
of an agent may change just by itself and write a linear mas-
ter equation for the probability distribution. Because only
one particle is considered, this approach cannot adequately
incorporate conservation of money. In reality, an agent can
change money only by interacting with another agent, thus the
problem requires a two-particle probability distribution func-
tion. Using Boltzmann’s molecular chaos hypothesis, the two-
particle function is factorized into a product of two single-
particle distributions functions, which results in the nonlinear
Boltzmann equation. Conservation of money is adequately in-
corporated in this two-particle approach, and the universality
of the exponential Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution is transpar-
ent.

I. Conclusions

Everywhere in this chapter we assumed some randomness
in the exchange of money. Our results would apply the best to
the probability distribution of money in a closed community
of gamblers. In more traditional economic studies, the agents
exchange money not randomly, but following deterministic
strategies, such as maximization of utility functions5,12. The
concept of equilibrium in these studies is similar to mechan-
ical equilibrium in physics, which is achieved by minimizing
energy or maximizing utility. However, for big ensembles,
statistical equilibrium is a more relevant concept. When many
heterogeneous agents deterministically interact and spend var-
ious amounts of money from very little to very big, the money
exchange is effectively random. In the future, we would like
to uncover the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution of money in a
simulation of a big ensemble of economic agents following re-
alistic deterministic strategies with money conservation taken
into account. That would be the economics analog of molecu-
lar dynamics simulations in physics. While atoms collide fol-
lowing fully deterministic equations of motion, their energy
exchange is effectively random due to the complexity of the
system and results in the Boltzmann-Gibbs law.

We do not claim that the real economy is in equilibrium.
(Most of the physical world around us is not in true equilib-
rium either.) Nevertheless, the concept of statistical equilib-
rium is a very useful reference point for studying nonequilib-
rium phenomena.

II. DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME AND WEALTH

A.

Introduction

In Ch. I we predicted that the distribution of money should
follow an exponential Boltzmann-Gibbs law. Unfortunately,
we were not able to ﬁnd data on the distribution of money. On
the other hand, we found many sources with data on income
distribution for the United States (USA) and United Kingdom
(UK), as well as data on the wealth distribution in the UK,
which are presented in this chapter. In all of these data, we
ﬁnd that the great majority of the population is described by
an exponential distribution, whereas the high-end tail follows
a power law.

The study of income distribution has a long history.
Pareto14 proposed in 1897 that income distribution obeys a
universal power law valid for all times and countries. Sub-
sequent studies have often disputed this conjecture. In 1935,
Shirras15 concluded: “There is indeed no Pareto Law. It is
time it should be entirely discarded in studies on distribu-
tion”. Mandelbrot16 proposed a “weak Pareto law” applica-
ble only asymptotically to the high incomes. In such a form,
Pareto’s proposal is useless for describing the great majority
of the population.

Many other distributions of income were proposed: Levy,
log-normal, Champernowne, Gamma, and two other forms by
Pareto himself (see a systematic survey in the World Bank re-
search publication17). Theoretical justiﬁcations for these pro-
posals form two schools: socio-economic and statistical. The
former appeals to economic, political, and demographic fac-
tors to explain the distribution of income (e. g.18), whereas the
latter invokes stochastic processes. Gibrat19 proposed in 1931
that income is governed by a multiplicative random process,
which results in a log-normal distribution (see also20). How-
ever, Kalecki21 pointed out that the width of this distribution
is not stationary, but increases in time. Levy and Solomon22
proposed a cut-off at lower incomes, which stabilizes the dis-
tribution to a power law.

Many researchers tried to deduce the Pareto law from a the-
ory of stochastic processes. Gibrat19 proposed in 1931 that
income and wealth are governed by multiplicative random
processes, which result in a log-normal distribution. These
ideas were later followed, among many others, by Montroll
and Shlesinger20. However, already in 1945 Kalecki21 pointed
out that the log-normal distribution is not stationary, because
its width increases in time. Modern econophysicists22,33,34
also use various versions of multiplicative random processes
in theoretical modeling of wealth and income distributions.

Unfortunately, numerous recent papers on this subject do
very little or no comparison at all with real statistical data,
much of which is widely available these days on the Inter-

8

net.
In order to ﬁll this gap, we analyzed the data on in-
come distribution in the United States (US) from the Bureau
of Census and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in Ref.35.
We found that the individual income of about 95% of popu-
lation is described by the exponential law. The exponential
law, also known in physics as the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribu-
tion, is characteristic for a conserved variable, such as energy.
In Ref.36, we argued that, because money (cash) is conserved,
the probability distribution of money should be exponential.
Wealth can increase or decrease by itself, but money can only
be transferred from one agent to another. So, wealth is not
conserved, whereas money is. The difference is the same as
the difference between unrealized and realized capital gains in
stock market.

In Sec. II B, we propose that the distribution of individual
income is given by an exponential function. This conjecture
is inspired by the results of Ch. I,35, where we argued that the
probability distribution of money in a closed system of agents
is given by the exponential Boltzmann-Gibbs function. We
compare our proposal with the census and tax data for individ-
ual income in USA. In Sec. II D we show that the exponential
distribution has to be amended for the top 5% of incomes by
a power-law function. In Sec. II F, we derive the distribution
function of income for families with two earners and compare
it with census data. In Sec. II G, we discuss the distribution of
wealth. In Sec. II H we critically examine several other alter-
natives proposed in the literature for the distribution of income
and wealth. Speculations on the possible origins of the expo-
nential and power-law distribution of income and conclusions
for this chapter are given in Sec. II I.

B. Distribution of income for individuals

C. Exponential distribution of income

We denote income by the letter r (for “revenue”). The prob-
ability distribution function of income, P (r), (called the prob-
ability density in book17) is deﬁned so that the fraction of in-
dividuals with income between r and r + dr is P (r) dr. This
0 P (r) dr = 1. We
propose that the probability distribution of individual income
is exponential:

function is normalized to unity (100%):R ∞

P1(r) = exp(−r/R)/R,

(7)

R ∞

where the subscript 1 indicates individuals. Function (7)
contains one parameter R, equal to the average income:
0 r P1(r) dr = R, and analogous to temperature in the
Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution35.

From the Survey of Income and Program Participation
(SIPP)23, we downloaded the variable TPTOINC (total in-
come of a person for a month) for the ﬁrst “wave” (a four-
month period) in 1996. Then we eliminated the entries with
zero income, grouped the remaining entries into bins of the
size 10/3 k$, counted the numbers of entries inside each bin,
and normalized to the total number of entries. The results are
shown as the histogram in Fig. 6, where the horizontal scale

different sources to the exponential law (7) with the bases e, 2, and
10, and the sizes of the statistical data sets.

Plot B in the inset of Fig. 6 shows the data from the Panel
Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) conducted by the Insti-
tute for Social Research of the University of Michigan24. We
downloaded the variable V30821 “Total 1992 labor income”
for individuals from the Final Release 1993 and processed the
data in a similar manner. Shown is the cumulative probabil-
ity distribution of income N (r) (called the probability dis-
tribution in book17). It is deﬁned as N (r) = R ∞
r P (r′) dr′
and gives the fraction of individuals with income greater than
r. For the exponential distribution (7), the cumulative dis-
tribution is also exponential: N1(r) = R ∞
r P1(r′) dr′ =
exp(−r/R). Thus, R2 is the median income; 10% of popula-
tion have income greater than R10 and only 1% greater than
2R10. The points in the inset fall onto a straight line in the

logarithmic scale. The slope is given in line (a) of Table I.

The points in Fig. 7 show the cumulative distribution of
tax returns vs income in 1997 from column 1 of Table 1.1
of Ref.25. (We merged 1 k$ bins into 5 k$ bins in the interval
1–20 k$.) The solid line is a ﬁt to the exponential law. Plot A
in the inset of Fig. 7 shows the same data with the logarithmic
vertical scale. The slope is given in line (e) of Table I. Plot
B in the inset of Fig. 7 shows the distribution of individual
income from tax returns in 199326. The logarithmic slope is
given in line (b) of Table I.

While Figs. 6 and 7 clearly demostrate the ﬁt of income
distribution to the exponential form, they have the following
drawback. Their horizontal axes extend to +∞, so the high-
income data are left outside of the plots. The standard way to
represent the full range of data is the so-called Lorenz curve
(for an introduction to the Lorenz curve and Gini coefﬁcient,
see book17). The horizontal axis of the Lorenz curve, x(r),
represents the cumulative fraction of population with income
below r, and the vertical axis y(r) represents the fraction of
income this population accounts for:

x(r) =Z r

0

P (r′) dr′,

y(r) = R r
R ∞

0 r′P (r′) dr′
0 r′P (r′) dr′

.

(8)

As r changes from 0 to ∞, x and y change from 0 to 1, and
Eq. (8) parametrically deﬁnes a curve in the (x, y)-space.

Substituting Eq. (7) into Eq. (8), we ﬁnd

x(˜r) = 1 − exp(−˜r),

y(˜r) = x(˜r) − ˜r exp(−˜r),

(9)

where ˜r = r/R. Excluding ˜r, we ﬁnd the explicit form of the
Lorenz curve for the exponential distribution:

y = x + (1 − x) ln(1 − x).

(10)

R drops out, so Eq. (10) has no ﬁtting parameters.

Points: IRS data for 1979–199727. Inset points: Gini coefﬁcient data
from IRS27. Inset line: The calculated value 1/2 of the Gini coefﬁ-
cient for the exponential distribution.

The function (10) is shown as the solid curve in Fig. 8. The
straight diagonal line represents the Lorenz curve in the case
where all population has equal income. Inequality of income
distribution is measured by the Gini coefﬁcient G, the ratio of
the area between the diagonal and the Lorenz curve to the area
of the triangle beneath the diagonal

G = 2Z 1

0

(x − y) dx

(11)

The Gini coefﬁcient is conﬁned between 0 (no inequality) and
1 (extreme inequality). By substituting Eq. (10) into the inte-
gral, we ﬁnd the Gini coefﬁcient for the exponential distribu-
tion: G1 = 1/2.

The points in Fig. 8 represent the tax data during 1979–
1997 from Ref.27. With the progress of time, the Lorenz points
shifted downward and the Gini coefﬁcient increased from 0.47
to 0.56, which indicates increasing inequality during this pe-
riod. However, overall the Gini coefﬁcient is close to the value
0.5 calculated for the exponential distribution, as shown in the
inset of Fig. 8.

D. Power-law tail and “Bose” condensation

As Fig. 8 shows, the Lorenz curve deviates from the theo-
retical Lorenz curve implied by the exponential distribution,
mostly for the top 20% of tax returns. Moreover, as explained
in the previous section, the Lorenz curve for a pure exponen-
tial distribution is independent of temperature (the scale of the
distribution). Therefore the variations in the Lorenz curves
over the period 1979-1997 suggest that the shape of the distri-
bution changes.

FIG. 9: Cumulative probability distribution of US individual income
for 1997 in log-log scale, with points (raw data) and solid lines (ex-
ponential and power-law ﬁt). The inset shows the exponential regime
and the ﬁt with a Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution in the log-linear
scale.

In Sec. II A we mentioned the early proposal of Pareto, who
claimed that the income distribution obeys a universal power
law valid for all times and countries14. The Pareto distribution
P (r) = A/rα has several undesirable properties. It diverges
for low incomes, and if α < 2 the distribution has a diverg-
ing ﬁrst moment. These two properties are never found in real
data. Moreover, our study has shown that at least for the over-
whelming majority (95%) of the population the distribution of
income is exponential.

The data for the remaining top 5% percent of the population
is hard to get and often it is unreliable. Because the number
of people with income in the top few percents is small, census
data is poor. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has reliable
data but it seldom reports it. We managed to ﬁnd a data set
from IRS which contains high income data25.

Fig. 9 shows United States IRS income data for 199725. The
data points represent the cumulative probability distribution in
log-log scale. Although for large income values r > 120k$
we have only three data points, the points align on a straight
line in accordance with a Pareto power-law distribution.

From the plot it is evident that there is a discontinuity
around 120k$ where the exponential and power-law regimes
intersect. We conclude that it is not possible to describe
the entire income distribution with one single differentiable
function. The two regimes of the probability distribution
are clearly separated and this may be due to different in-
come dynamics in the two regimes. Among others,
the
Adjusted Gross Income contains capital gains that is stock-
market gains/losses. It is conceivable that for the top 5% of
the population, capital gains rather than the labor income ac-
count for the majority share of the total income. The capital
gains contribution to the Adjusted Growth Income may be re-
sponsible for the observed power-law in the tail of the income
distribution.

We plot the Lorenz curve for income in Fig. 10. As in Sec.

(12) with fraction b = 16%).

FIG. 11: Cumulative probability distributions of yearly individual
income for different states of the USA shown as raw data (top inset)
and scaled data in log-log, log-linear (lower inset).

II B the horizontal and vertical coordinates are the cumula-
tive population x(r) and the cumulative income y(r) from (8).
An imaginary line through the data shows an abrupt change
in derivative for the last 2% of the tax returns. This sudden
change in derivative around the 98% mark on the horizontal
axis of Fig. 10 gives an almost inﬁnite slope for the Lorenz
curve. Physically, an inﬁnite slope in the Lorenz function for
arguments x just slightly less than one, is equivalent to hav-
ing a ﬁnite amount of total society’s income in the hand of a
very few individuals. We have coined for this effect the name
“Bose condensation of income” because of similarities with
the celebrated phase-transition from statistical mechanics.

To understand quantitatively the “Bose condensation” of
income, we calculate f the ratio of the total income of the
society if all the population is described by the exponential
law, to the actual total income of the population. For the
USA tax income data for 1997 shown in Fig. 10 this frac-
tion was f = 0.84, which means that the “condensate” has
b = 1 − f = 16% of the total income of the population. The
analytical formula for the Lorenz curve in this case is

y = (1 − b)[x + (1 − x) ln(1 − x)] + bδ(1 − x),

(12)

term represents the contribution of

where the ﬁrst
the
Boltzmann-Gibbs exponential regime and the second term
represents the contribution of the Pareto power-law tail. It is
remarkable that as in the case of (10), Eq. 12 does not have any
ﬁtting parameters. The condensate fraction b is completely de-
termined by temperature, which in turn is determined from the
probability distribution.

The function (12) is plotted as a solid line in Fig. 9. One can
see that the data systematically deviate from the exponential
law because of the income concentrated in the power-law tail;
however, the deviation is not very big. The inequality of the
US income distribution was also increasing during that time
period35, which implies that the size of the “Bose condensate”
has increased in time, too.

The Gini coefﬁcient deﬁned in (11) can be calculated for the
Lorenz curve given by (12). The effect of the power-law tails
changes the value of the Gini coefﬁcient from G1 = 1/2 in
the case of a pure exponential distribution to Gb = (1 + b)/2.

E. Geographical variations in income distribution

In the previous sections we found that the distribution of
income is an exponential for the large majority of the popu-
lation followed by a power-law tail for the top few percent of
the population. It would be interesting to establish the univer-
sality of this shape for various other countries.

We obtained the data on distribution of the yearly individ-
ual income in 1998 for each of the 50 states and the District
of Columbia that constitute the USA from the Web site of the
IRS42. We plot the original raw data for the cumulative distri-
bution of income in log-linear scale in the upper inset of Fig.
11. The points spread signiﬁcantly, particularly at higher in-
comes. For example, the fraction of individuals with income
greater than 1 M$ varies by an order of magnitude between
different states. However, after we rescale the data in the man-
ner described in the preceding section, the points collapse on
a single curve shown in log-log scale in the main panel and
log-linear scale in the lower inset. The open circles represent
the US average, obtained by treating the combined data for
all states as a single set. We observe that the distribution of
higher incomes approximately follows a power law with the
exponent α = 1.7 ± 0.1, where the ±0.1 variation includes
70% of all states. On the other hand, for about 95% of indi-
viduals with lower incomes, the distribution follows an expo-
nential law with the average US temperature RUS = 36.4 k$
(R(2)
US = 83.9 k$). The temperatures of
the individual states differ from RUS by the amounts shown in
Table II. For example, the temperature of Connecticut (CT) is
1.25 times higher and the temperature of West Virginia (WV)

US = 25.3 k$ and R(10)

is 0.78 times lower than the average US temperature.

The Lorenz plot for all states is shown in Fig. 12 together
with the solid curve representing Eq. (10). The majority of
points are well clustered and are not too far from the solid
curve. The exceptions are Wyoming (WY) with much higher
inequality and the Washington state (WA) with noticeably
lower inequality of income distribution. The average US
data, shown by open circles, is consistent with our previous
results35. Unlike in the UK case, we did not make any ad-
justment in the US case for individuals with income below the
threshold, which appears to be sufﬁciently low.

We obtained the data on the yearly income distribution in
the UK for 1997/8 and 1998/9 from the Web site of the IR39.
The data for 1994/5, 1995/6, and 1996/7 were taken from the
Annual Abstract of Statistics derived from the IR40. The data
for these 5 years are presented graphically in Fig. 13. In the
upper inset, the original raw data for the cumulative distribu-
tion are plotted in log-linear scale. For not too high incomes,
the points form straight lines, which implies the exponential
distribution N (r) ∝ exp(−r/R), where r stands for income
(revenue), and R is the income “temperature”. However, the
slopes of these lines are different for different years. The tem-
peratures for the years 1994/5, 1995/6, 1996/7, and 1997/8
differ from the temperature for 1998/9, R(98/9)
UK = 11.7 k£

UK = 8.1 k£ and R(10)

(R(2)
UK = 26.9 k£), by the factors 0.903,
0.935, 0.954, and 0.943. To compensate for this effect, we
rescale the data. We divide the horizontal coordinates (in-
comes) of the data sets for different years by the quoted above
factors and plot the results in log-log scale in the main panel
and log-linear scale in the lower inset. We observe scaling: the
collapse of points onto a single curve. Thus, the distributions
Ni(r) for different years i are described by a single function
f (r/Ri). The main panel shows that this scaling function f
follows a power law with the exponent α = 2.0-2.3 at high in-
comes. The lower inset shows that f has an exponential form
for about 95% of individuals with lower incomes. These re-
sults qualitatively agree with a similar study by Cranshaw41.
He proposed that the P (r) data for lower incomes are better
ﬁtted by the Gamma distribution Γ(r) ∝ rβ exp(−r/R). For
simplicity, we chose not to introduce the additional ﬁtting pa-
rameter β.

We must mention that the individuals with income below a
certain threshold are not required to report to the IR. That is
why the data in the lower inset do not extend to zero income.
We extrapolate the straight line to zero income and take the
intercept with the vertical axis as 100% of individuals. Thus,
we imply that the IR data does not account for about 25-27%
of individuals with income below the threshold.

The Lorenz curve for the distribution of the UK income
is shown in Fig. 14. We treat the number of individuals be-
low the income threshold and their total income as adjustable
parameters, which are the horizontal and vertical offsets of
the coordinates origin relative to the lowest known data point.
These parameters are chosen to ﬁt the Lorenz curve for the
exponential law (10) shown as the solid line. The ﬁt is very
good, and is illustrated in Fig. 13. The horizontal offsets are
28-34%, which is roughly consistent with the numbers quoted
for the lower inset of the left panel.

The income temperature for the UK in 1998/9 was RUK =
11.7 k£ and for the US in 1998 was RUS = 36.4 k$. Us-
ing the exchange rate as of December 31, 1998 to convert
pounds into dollars45, we ﬁnd that the UK temperature was
RUK = 19.5 k$, which is 1.87 times lower than the US tem-
perature. The difference in temperatures indicates nonequilib-
rium, which can be exploited to create a thermal machine36.
The gain (proﬁt) produced by such a thermal machine is pro-
portional to the difference in temperatures. In agreement with
the second law of thermodynamics, money would ﬂow from a
high-temperature system to a low-temperature one. This may
explain the huge trade deﬁcit of the USA in global interna-
tional trade with other, lower-temperature countries. The vari-
ation of temperatures between different states of the USA is
shown in Table II.

F. Distribution of income for

families

Now let us discuss the distribution of income for families
with two earners. The family income r is the sum of two indi-
vidual incomes: r = r1+r2. Thus, the probability distribution
of the family income is given by the convolution of the indi-
vidual probability distributions28. If the latter are given by the
exponential function (7), the two-earners probability distribu-
tion function P2(r) is

P2(r) =Z r

0

P1(r′)P1(r − r′) dr′ =

r
R2 e−r/R.

(13)

The function P2(r) (13) differs from the function P1(r) (7) by
the prefactor r/R, which reﬂects the phase space available to
compose a given total income out of two individual ones. It is
shown as the solid curve in Fig. 15. Unlike P1(r), which has a

maximum at zero income, P2(r) has a maximum at r = R and
looks qualitatively similar to the family income distribution
curves in literature18.

From the same 1996 SIPP that we used in Sec. II B23, we
downloaded the variable TFTOTINC (the total family income
for a month), which we then multiplied by 12 to get annual
income. Using the number of family members (the variable
EFNP) and the number of children under 18 (the variable
RFNKIDS), we selected the families with two adults. Their
distribution of family income is shown by the histogram in
Fig. 15. The ﬁt to the function (13), shown by the solid line,
gives the parameter R listed in line (d) of Table I. The families
with two adults and more than two adults constitute 44% and
11% of all families in the studied set of data. The remaining
45% are the families with one adult. Assuming that these two
classes of families have two and one earners, we expect the
income distribution for all families to be given by the super-
position of Eqs. (7) and (13): 0.45P1(r) + 0.55P2(r). It is
shown by the solid line in the inset of Fig. 15 (with R from
line (d) of Table I) with the all families data histogram.

By substituting Eq. (13) into Eq. (8), we calculate the

Lorenz curve for two-earners families:

x(˜r) = 1 − (1 + ˜r)e−˜r,
y(˜r) = x(˜r) − ˜r2e−˜r/2.

(14)
(15)

It is shown by the solid curve in Fig. 17. Given that x −
y = ˜r2 exp(−˜r)/2 and dx = ˜r exp(−˜r) d˜r, the Gini coef-
ﬁcient for two-earners families is: G2 = 2R 1
0 (x − y) dx =
R ∞
0 ˜r3 exp(−2˜r) d˜r = 3/8 = 0.375. The points in Fig. 17
show the Lorenz data and Gini coefﬁcient for family income
during 1947–1994 from Table 1 of Ref.29. The Gini coefﬁ-
cient is very close to the calculated value 0.375.

The fundamental assumption which underlies the derivation
of (13) is the independence of the two incomes r1 and r2 of

FIG. 16: Points: The income for families with two earners in 199924.
One family is represented by two points (r1, r2) and (r2, r1). The
existence of correlations between r1 and r2 is equivalent to a cluster-
ing of points along the diagonal. The data shows little evidence for
such correlation.

the two-earner family. While the good ﬁt of the function (13)
is an implicit validation of this assumption, it would be good
to show that the assumption holds true directly from data. The
Census database does not provide the individual values of r1
and r2, but only their sum r = r1 + r2. We found that the
PSID survey24 does have give for a family with two earners,
each earners contribution to the total income of the family. We
downloaded the variable ER16463 (total labor income, head)
and ER16465 (total labor income, wife). We represent in Fig.
16 each family by two points (r1, r2) and (r2, r1). The ex-
istence of correlations between r1 and r2 is equivalent to a
clustering of points along the diagonal. Or stated otherwise,
the independence of r1 and r2 should result in a uniform dis-
tribution of points on inﬁnitesimal strips perpendicular to the
diagonal. The plotted data shows little, if any evidence for
such correlation.

The distributions of the individual and family income dif-
fer qualitatively. The former monotonically increases toward
the low end and has a maximum at zero income (Fig. 6).
The latter, typically being a sum of two individual incomes,
has a maximum at a ﬁnite income and vanishes at zero (Fig.
15). Thus, the inequality of the family income distribution
is smaller. The Lorenz data for families follow the different
Eq. (15), again without ﬁtting parameters, and the Gini coef-
ﬁcient is close to the smaller calculated value 0.375 (Fig. 17).
Despite different deﬁnitions of income by different agencies,
the parameters extracted from the ﬁts (Table I) are consistent,
except for line (e).

The qualitative difference between the individual and fam-
ily income distributions was emphasized in Ref.26, which split
up joint tax returns of families into individual incomes and
combined separately ﬁled tax returns of married couples into
family incomes. However, Refs.25 and27 counted only “indi-

vidual tax returns”, which also include joint tax returns. Since
only a fraction of families ﬁle jointly, we assume that the latter
contribution is small enough not to distort the tax returns dis-
tribution from the individual income distribution signiﬁcantly.
Similarly, the deﬁnition of a family for the data shown in the
inset of Fig. 15 includes single adults and one-adult families
with children, which constitute 35% and 10% of all families.
The former category is excluded from the deﬁnition of a fam-
ily for the data29 shown in Fig. 17, but the latter is included.
Because the latter contribution is relatively small, we expect
the family data in Fig. 17 to approximately represent the two-
earners distribution (13). Technically, even for the families
with two (or more) adults shown in Fig. 15, we do not know
the exact number of earners.

With all these complications, one should not expect perfect
accuracy for our ﬁts. There are deviations around zero income
in Figs. 6, 7, and 15. The ﬁts could be improved there by mul-
tiplying the exponential function by a polynomial. However,
the data may not be accurate at the low end because of under-
reporting. For example, ﬁling a tax return is not required for
incomes below a certain threshold, which ranged in 1999 from
$2,750 to $14,40030. As the Lorenz curves in Figs. 8 and 17
show, there are also deviations at the high end, possibly where
Pareto’s power law is supposed to work. Nevertheless, the
exponential law gives an overall good description of income
distribution for the great majority of the population.

Figs. 6 and 7 demonstrate that the exponential law (7) ﬁts
the individual income distribution very well. The Lorenz data
for the individual income follow Eq. (10) without ﬁtting pa-
rameters, and the Gini coefﬁcient is close to the calculated
value 0.5 (Fig. 8).

It is interesting to study the distribution of the Gini index
across the globe. We present in Fig. 18 data from a World
Bank publication48. This is an question of utmost importance
for the World Bank since the distribution of the Gini index

FIG. 18: Distribution of Gini index for households across the globe

America, the Gini index is close to 0.375, the value predicted in Sec.

reﬂects the degree of inequality (poverty) in various regions
of the globe. For West Europe and North America, the Gini
index is close to 0.375, the value we predicted in Sec. II F. A
sharp increase in inequality is observed in the Eastern Europe
and the Former Soviet Union (FSU) republics after the fall of
the “iron curtain” when socialist economies where replaced
by market-like economies. We conjecture that the high value
of the Gini index in Asia may be due to the fact that a typical
family in Asia has only one earner, so the Gini index is close
to a value of 0.5 as observed for individuals.

As the evidence from Fig. 17 and Fig. 18 shows the value of
the Gini index varies in time and across the globe, but for the
Western world it is close to the value of 0.375, as predicted in
Sec. II F.

G. Distribution of wealth

In this section, we discuss the cumulative probability dis-
tribution of wealth N (w)=(the number of people whose in-
dividual wealth is greater than w)/(the total number of peo-
ple). A plot of N vs. w is equivalent to a plot of a person’s
rank in wealth vs. wealth, which is often used for top rich-
est people37. We will use the power law, N (w) ∝ 1/wα,
and the exponential law N (w) ∝ exp(−w/W ), to ﬁt the
data. These distributions are characterized by the exponent
α and the “temperature” W . The corresponding probability
densities, P (w) = −dN (w)/dw, also follow a power law or
an exponential law. For the exponential law, it is also use-
ful to deﬁne the temperatures W (2) (also known as the me-
dian) and W (10) using the bases of 1/2 and 1/10: N (w) ∝
(1/2)w/W (2)

∝ (1/10)w/W (10).

FIG. 19: Left panel: Cumulative probability distribution of to-
tal net capital (wealth) shown in log-log, log-linear (inset) coordi-
nates. Points: the actual data. Solid lines: ﬁts to the exponential
(Boltzmann-Gibbs) and power (Pareto) laws.

The distribution of wealth is not easy to measure, because
people do not report their total wealth routinely. However,
when a person dies, all assets must be reported for the pur-
pose of inheritance tax. Using these data and an adjustment
procedure, the British tax agency, the Inland Revenue (IR), re-
constructed wealth distribution of the whole UK population.
In Figs. 19 and 20, we present the 1996 data obtained from
their Web site38. Fig. 19 shows the cumulative probability as
a function of the personal total net capital (wealth), which is
composed of assets (cash, stocks, property, household goods,
etc.) and liabilities (mortgages and other debts). The main
panel illustrates in the log-log scale that above 100 k£ the
data follow a power law with the exponent α = 1.9. The
inset shows in the log-linear scale that below 100 k£ the
data is very well ﬁtted by an exponential distribution with
the temperature WUK = 59.6 k£ (W (2)
UK = 41.3 k£ and
W (10)

UK = 137.2 k£).
Since we have estabilished that the distribution of wealth
has an exponential regime followed by a power-law tail, we
plot the Lorenz curve for wealth in the right panel of Fig. 20.
As in Sec. II B the horizontal and vertical coordinates are the
cumulative population x(w) and the cumulative wealth y(w):

As in the case of US income data Fig. 10, there is an abrupt
change in the Lorenz curve for the top few percent of peo-
ple. We interpret this fact in the same way as in Sec. II D,
as a “Bose condensation of wealth”. Again, we calculate f
the fraction of the total wealth of the society if all people are
described by the exponential law, to the actual total wealth
of the society. For the United Kingdom in 1996, this frac-

FIG. 20: Points: Lorenz plot for wealth, United Kingdom 199638.
Solid curve: The Lorenz curve given by (18) with a condensate frac-
tion of b = 16%.

tion was f = 0.84, which means that the “condensate” has
b = 1 − f = 16% of the total wealth of the system. The
functional form for the Lorenz curve for wealth is

y = (1 − b)[x + (1 − x) ln(1 − x)] + bδ(1 − x).

(18)

This function is plotted as a solid line in Fig. 20. One can
see that the data systematically deviate from the exponential
law because of the wealth concentrated in the power-law tail;
however, the deviation is not very big. The so-called Gini
coefﬁcient17,35, which measures the inequality of wealth dis-
tribution, has increased from 64% in 1984 to 68% in 199638.
This value is bigger than the Gini coefﬁcient 50% for a purely
exponential distribution35.

While there seems to be no controversy about the fact that
a few people hold a ﬁnite fraction of the entire wealth, the
speciﬁc value of this fraction varies widely in the literature.
Fractions as high as 80-90% were reported in the literature43
without any support from data. We provide a clear procedure
of how to calculate this factor, and we ﬁnd that b = 16%.

H. Other distributions for income and wealth

As we discussed in the introduction, Sec. II A there have
been many proposed functional forms for the distribution of
income and wealth. In this section we will investigate several
of them.

In Secs. II B, II D, II E and II G we have shown ample evi-
dence to support our ﬁndings that the distribution on income
and wealth have a similar structure with an exponential part
followed by a power-law tail. These results immediately in-
validate the proposed Pareto or Gamma distributions as the
correct distribution of income.

Another popular distribution which has been proposed for
many years as the distribution of income is the lognormal

FIG. 21: Points: Calculated probability density P (r) for United
States IRS income data for 1997 multiplied by income r, i.e. rP (r).
Curve: Fit of data with function ˜P (r) = rPLN (r) (19) with a

scribe the data points accurately.

distribution20. The lognormal distribution has the expression

PLN (r) =

1

r√2πσ2

exp(cid:20)−

(ln r − µ)2

2σ2

(cid:21) ,

(19)

where µ and σ are two parameters. As given by (19) the
functional form of the lognormal distribution makes it hard
to compare it with data. But the function ˜P (r) = rPLN (r)
is a quadratic function in a log-log plot. In Fig. 21 we plot-
ted ln ˜P (r) versus ln r for the 1997 income data from IRS25.
As it can be seen from Fig. 21 a ﬁt of ˜P (r) with a quadratic
function cannot be made. The data points show the power-
law regime for high incomes. We conclude that the lognormal
distribution does not describe the distribution of income.

The distribution of wealth has essentially the same struc-
ture as the distribution of income. An exponential regime
for low wealth values and a power-law tail for high wealth
values. Contrary to the distribution of income, the distribu-
tion of wealth appears to have a continuous derivative in the
cross-over between the two regimes (see the discussion at the
beginning of Sec. II D). The shape of the wealth distribution
suggests a modiﬁcation of the regular exponential Boltzmann-
Gibbs distribution for values of wealth w ≫ W . In the past
years, in the context of non-extensive statistical mechanics,
Tsallis has proposed a viable alternative to the Boltzmann-
Gibbs distribution46.

The Tsallis distribution can be obtained by maximizing
a generalized entropy and is the subject of a lot of current
research. The appeal of the Tsallis distribution is that it
has power-law tails for large arguments, and that in certain
limit it becomes the exponential distribution. The Tsallis
distribution46 has the expression

where WT is the dimensional parameter of the Tsallis distribu-
tion, analogous to the temperature of the exponential distribu-
tion. In the limit q → 1, the distribution goes to the exponen-
tial form Pq=1(w) ∝ e−w/WT . For q > 1, the distribution has
a power-law decay Pq(w) ∼ (1/w)q/q−1 for values w ≫ W .
In Fig. 22 we present the ﬁt of UK wealth data with the
Tsallis distribution. Overall, the quality of the ﬁt is good. The
parameters of the Tsallis distribution implied by the ﬁt are:
q = 1.42, and for the Tsallis temperature WT = 41k£.

Another distribution proposed by Kaniadakis47 in the con-
text of non-extensive statistical mechanics has the form of a
deformed exponential

Pκ(x) =(cid:16)p1 + κ2x2 − κx(cid:17)1/κ

,

(21)

where x = w/Wκ. For κ → 0, the distribution has the ex-
ponential form Pκ=0(w) = e−w/Wκ. For large arguments
w ≫ W , the distribution (21) has the power-law behavior
Pκ(w) ≈ (1/w)1/κ. The ﬁt with the Kaniadakis distribution
is even better than that with the Tsallis distribution, as shown
in Fig. 22. The parameters of the ﬁt for the Kaniadakis dis-
tribution are: κ = 0.33 and for the Kaniadakis temperature
Wκ = 45k£.

A distribution for wealth put forward by Bouchaud and
M´ezard33, and independently by Solomon and Richmond32,
is

Pα(x) =

(α − 1)α
Γ(α)

exp(− α−1
x )
xα+1

,

(22)

where x = w/Wc. This distribution has an exponentially
sharp cut-off for wealths w ≪ Wc, and a power-law tail
Pα(w) ∝ 1/wα+1 for w ≫ Wc. The ﬁt of the UK wealth

17

data with the distribution (22) is presented in Fig. 22. The
values we obtain for the parameters are: α = 1.93 and
Wc = 74 k£. The distribution (22) has its maximum at
xmax = (α − 1)/(α + 1) = 0.32, which essentially states
that for w > 0.32Wc = 23k£ the distribution is a power law.
As seen in Fig. 22 this claim is not supported by data. More-
over, the percent of people in the power-law tail predicted by
dxPα(x) = 81%, is clearly much
larger than what is observed from the Lorenz curve for wealth,
Fig. 20.

the distribution (22),R ∞

xmax

All three proposed distributions (20,21,22) seem to capture
well the power-law tail. In the inset of Fig. 22 a log-linear
scale is used, and this makes the discrepancy between (22)
and data much more evident. The distribution (22) is clearly
inappropriate for low incomes.

I. Conclusions

Our analysis of the data shows that there are two clear
regimes in the distribution of individual income. For low and
moderate incomes up to approximately 95% of the total pop-
ulation, the distribution is well described by an exponential,
while the income of the top 5% individuals is described by a
power-law (Pareto) regime.

The exponential Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution naturally
applies to quantities that obey a conservation law, such as en-
ergy or money35. However, there is no fundamental reason
why the sum of incomes (unlike the sum of money) must be
conserved. Indeed, income is a term in the time derivative
of one’s money balance (the other term is spending). Maybe
incomes obey an approximate conservation law, or somehow
the distribution of income is simply proportional to the distri-
bution of money, which is exponential35.

Another explanation involves hierarchy. Groups of peo-
ple have leaders, which have leaders of a higher order, and
so on. The number of people decreases geometrically (ex-
ponentially) with the hierarchical level. If individual income
increases linearly with the hierarchical level, then the income
distribution is exponential. However, if income increases mul-
tiplicatively, then the distribution follows a power law31. For
moderate incomes below $100,000, the linear increase may
be more realistic. A similar scenario is the Bernoulli trials28,
where individuals have a constant probability of increasing
their income by a ﬁxed amount.

We found scaling in the cumulative probability distributions
N (r) of individual income r derived from the tax statistics for
different years in the UK and for different states in the US. The
distributions Ni(r) have the scaling form f (r/Ri), where the
scale Ri (the temperature) varies from one data set i to an-
other, but the scaling function f does not. The function f has
an exponential (Boltzmann-Gibbs) form at the low end, which
covers about 95% of individuals. At the high end, it follows
a power (Pareto) law with the exponents about 2.1 for the UK
and 1.7 for the US. Wealth distribution in the UK also has a
qualitatively similar shape with the exponent about 1.9 and
the temperature WUK = 60 k£. Some of the other values of
the exponents found in literature are 1.5 proposed by Pareto

himself (α = 1.5), 1.36 found by Levy and Solomon37 for the
distribution of wealth in the Forbes 400 list, and 2.05 found by
Souma44 for the high end of income distribution in Japan. The
latter study is similar to our work in the sense that it also uses
tax statistics and explores the whole range of incomes, not just
the high end. Souma44 ﬁnds that the probability density P (r)
at lower incomes follows a log-normal law with a maximum
at a nonzero income. This is in contrast to our results, which
suggest that the maximum of P (r) is at zero income. The dis-
repancy may be due to the high threshold for tax reporting in
Japan, which distorts the data at the low end. On the other
hand, if the data is indeed valid, it may reﬂect the actual dif-
ference between the social stuctures of the US/UK and Japan.

III. DISTRIBUTION OF STOCK-PRICE FLUCTUATIONS

A.

Introduction

Stochastic dynamics of stock prices is commonly described
by a geometric (multiplicative) Brownian motion, which gives
a log-normal probability distribution for stock price changes
(returns)50. However, numerous observations show that the
tails of the distribution decay slower than the log-normal
distribution predicts (the so-called “fat-tails” effect)51,52,53.
Particularly, much attention was devoted to the power-law
tails54,55. The geometric Brownian motion model has two pa-
rameters: the drift µ, which characterizes the average growth
rate, and the volatility σ, which characterizes the noisiness of
the process. There is empirical evidence and a set of stylized
facts indicating that volatility, instead of being a constant pa-
rameter, is driven by a mean-reverting stochastic process56,57.
Various mathematical models with stochastic volatility have
been discussed in literature58,59,60,61.

In this chapter, we study a particular stochastic volatil-
ity model, where the square root of the stock-price volatil-
ity, called the variance, follows a random process known in
ﬁnancial literature as the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process and in
mathematical statistics as the Feller process57,60. We solve the
Fokker-Planck equation for this model exactly and ﬁnd the
joint probability distribution of returns and variance as a func-
tion of time, conditional on the initial value of variance. The
solution is obtained in two different ways: using the method of
characteristics62 and the method of path integrals63,64,65. The
latter is more familiar to physicists working in ﬁnance61,66.

While returns are readily known from a ﬁnancial time se-
ries data, variance is not given directly, so it acts as a hidden
stochastic variable. Thus, we integrate the joint probability
distribution over variance and obtain the marginal probability
distribution of returns unconditional on variance. The latter
distribution can be directly compared with ﬁnancial data. We
ﬁnd excellent agreement between our results and the Dow-
Jones data for the period of 1982–2001. Using only four ﬁt-
ting parameters, our equations very well reproduce the proba-
bility distribution of returns for time lags between 1 and 250
trading days. This is in contrast to popular ARCH, GARCH,
EGARCH, TARCH, and similar models, where the number of
parameters can easily go to a few dozen67.

18

Our result for the probability distribution of returns has the
form of a one-dimensional Fourier integral, which is easily
calculated numerically or, in certain asymptotical limits, an-
alytically. For large returns, we ﬁnd that the probability dis-
tribution is exponential in log-returns, which implies a power-
law distribution for returns, and we calculate the time depen-
dence of the corresponding exponents. In the limit of long
times, the probability distribution exhibits scaling. It becomes
a function of a single combination of return and time, with
the scaling function expressed in terms of a Bessel function.
The Dow-Jones data follow the predicted scaling function for
seven orders of magnitude.

The original

theory of option pricing was developed
by Black and Scholes for the geometric Brownian motion
model50. Numerous attempts to improve it using stochastic
volatility models have been made57,58,59,60,61. Particularly, op-
tion pricing for the same model as in our paper49 was inves-
tigated by Heston60. Empirical studies68 show that Heston’s
theory fares better than the Black-Scholes model, but still
does not fully capture the real-market option prices. Since
our paper49 gives a closed-form time-dependent expression
for the probability distribution of returns that agrees with ﬁ-
nancial data, it can serve as a starting point for a better theory
of option pricing.

B. The model

We consider a stock, whose price St, as a function of time t,
obeys the stochastic differential equation of a geometric (mul-
tiplicative) Brownian motion50:

dSt = µSt dt + σtSt dW (1)

t

.

(23)

Here the subscript t indicates time dependence, µ is the drift
parameter, W (1)
is the standard random Wiener process81, and
σt is a time-dependent parameter, called the stock volatility,
which characterizes the noisiness of the Wiener process.

t

Since any solution of (23) depends only on σ2

t , it is conve-
t , which is called
nient to introduce the new variable vt = σ2
the variance. We assume that vt obeys the following mean-
reverting stochastic differential equation:

dvt = −γ(vt − θ) dt + κ√vt dW (2)

t

.

(24)

t

Here θ is the long-time mean of v, γ is the rate of relaxation
to this mean, W (2)
is the standard Wiener process, and κ is a
parameter that we call the variance noise. Eq. (24) is known
in ﬁnancial literature as the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) process
and in mathematical statistics as the Feller process57 (p. 42).
Alternative equations for vt, with the last term in (24) replaced
by κ dW (2)
, are also discussed in literature58.
However, in this chapter, we study only the case given by Eq.
(24).

or by κvt dW (2)

t

We take the Wiener process appearing in (24) to be corre-

lated with the Wiener process in (23):

dW (2)

t = ρ dW (1)

t +p1 − ρ2 dZt,

(25)

where Zt is a Wiener process independent of W (1)
, and ρ ∈
[−1, 1] is the correlation coefﬁcient. A negative correlation
(ρ < 0) between W (1)
is known as the leverage
effect57 (p. 41).

and W (2)

It is convenient to change the variable in (23) from price
St to log-return rt = ln(St/S0). Using Itˆo’s formula69, we
obtain the equation satisﬁed by rt:

drt =(cid:16)µ −

vt

2(cid:17) dt + √vt dW (1)

t

.

(26)

The parameter µ can be eliminated from (26) by changing the
variable to xt = rt − µt, which measures log-returns relative
to the growth rate µ:

dxt = −

vt
2

dt + √vt dW (1)

t

.

(27)

Where it does not cause confusion with rt, we use the term
“log-return” also for the variable xt.

Equations (27) and (24) deﬁne a two-dimensional stochas-
tic process for the variables xt and vt. This process is charac-
terized by the transition probability Pt(x, v | vi) to have log-
return x and variance v at time t given the initial log-return
x = 0 and variance vi at t = 0. Time evolution of Pt(x, v | vi)
is governed by the Fokker-Planck (or forward Kolmogorov)
equation69

The initial condition for (28) is a product of two delta func-
tions

Pt=0(x, v | vi) = δ(x) δ(v − vi).

(29)

The variance v is a positive quantity, so Eq. (28) is deﬁned
only for v > 0. However, when solving (28), it is convenient
to extend the domain of v so that v ∈ (−∞,∞). If 2γθ > κ2,
such an extension does not change the solution of the equa-
tion, because, given that P = 0 for v < 0 at the initial time
t = 0, the condition Pt(x, v < 0) = 0 is preserved for all
later times t > 0. In order to demonstrate this, let us consider
(28) in the limit v → 0:

Eq. (30) is a ﬁrst-order partial differential equation (PDE),
which describes propagation of P from negative v to positive
v with the positive velocity γθ − κ2/2. Thus, the nonzero
function P (x, v > 0) does not propagate to v < 0, and
Pt(x, v < 0) remains zero at all times t. Alternatively, it
is possible to show50 (p. 67) that, if 2γθ > κ2, the random
process (24) starting in the domain v > 0 can never reach the
domain v < 0.

Eq. (35) is simpler than (28), because the number of variables

be simpliﬁed by taking the Fourier transform over v

In (47) we treat ˆpv and ˆv as canonically conjugated op-
erators with the commutation relation [ˆv, ˆpv] = i. The
transition probability P px (v, t| vi) is the matrix element of
the evolution operator exp(− ˆHt) and has a path-integral
representation63,64,65
P t,px(v | vi) = hv|e− ˆHt|vii =Z Dv Dpv eSpx [pv (τ ),v(τ )].

(48)

Here the action functional Spx [pv(τ ), v(τ )] is

20

and the dot denotes the time derivative. The phase-space path
integral (48) is the sum over all possible paths pv(τ ) and v(τ )
with the boundary conditions v(τ = 0) = vi and v(τ = t) =
v imposed on v.

It is convenient to integrate the ﬁrst term on the r.h.s. of (49)

by parts:

Spx = i[pv(t)v − ˜pv(0)vi] − iγθZ t

(50)

where we also separated the terms linear in v(τ ) from the
Hamiltonian (47). Because v(τ ) enters linearly in the action
(50), taking the path integral over Dv generates the delta-
functional δ [pv(τ ) − ˜pv(τ )], where ˜pv(τ ) is the solution of
the ordinary differential equation (41) with a boundary con-
dition speciﬁed at τ = t. Taking the path integral over Dpv
resolves the delta-functional, and we ﬁnd

(51)

where ˜pv(τ = t) = pv. Eq. (51) coincides with (40) after the
Fourier transform (36).

E. Averaging over variance

Normally we are interested only in log-returns x and do not
care about variance v. Moreover, whereas log-returns are di-
rectly known from ﬁnancial data, variance is a hidden stochas-
tic variable that has to be estimated. Inevitably, such an esti-
mation is done with some degree of uncertainty, which pre-
cludes a clear-cut direct comparison between Pt(x, v | vi) and
ﬁnancial data. Thus, we introduce the probability distribution

Pt(x| vi) =Z +∞

−∞

dv Pt(x, v | vi),

(52)

where the hidden variable v is integrated out. The integration
of (45) over v generates the delta-function δ(pv), which ef-
fectively sets pv = 0. Substituting the coefﬁcient ζ from (44)
with pv = 0 into (45), we ﬁnd

To check the validity of (53), let us consider the case κ = 0.
In this case, the stochastic term in (24) is absent, so the time
evolution of variance is deterministic:

Then process (27) gives a Gaussian distribution for x,

(54)

(55)

tR t

with the time-averaged variance vt = 1
0 dτ v(τ ). Eq. (55)
demonstrates that the probability distribution of stock price S
is log-normal in the case κ = 0. On the other hand, by taking
the limit κ → 0 and integrating over px in (53), we reproduce
the same expression (55).
Eq. (53) cannot be directly compared with ﬁnancial time
series data, because it depends on the unknown initial variance
vi. In order to resolve this problem, we assume that vi has the
stationary probability distribution Π∗(vi), which is given by
(32).82 Thus we introduce the probability distribution Pt(x)
by averaging (53) over vi with the weight Π∗(vi):

Pt(x) =Z ∞

0

dvi Π∗(vi) Pt(x| vi).

(56)

The integral over vi is similar to the one of the Gamma func-
tion and can be taken explicitly. The ﬁnal result is the Fourier
integral

The variable px enters (58) via the variables Γ from (38) and
Ω from (43). It is easy to check that Pt(x) is real, because
ReF is an even function of px and ImF is an odd one. One
can also check that Ft(px = 0) = 0, which implies that Pt(x)

is correctly normalized at all times: R dx Pt(x) = 1. The

second term in the r.h.s. of (58) vanishes when ρ = 0, i.e.
when there are no correlations between stock price and vari-
ance. The simpliﬁed result for the case ρ = 0 is given in III F
by Eqs. (72), (73), and (74).

Eqs. (57) and (58) for the probability distribution Pt(x) of
log-return x at time t are the central analytical result of the
chapter. The integral in (57) can be calculated numerically
or, in certain regimes discussed in Secs. III F and III G, an-
alytically. In Fig. 23, the calculated function Pt(x), shown
by solid lines, is compared with the Dow-Jones data, shown
by dots. (Technical details of the data analysis are discussed
in Sec. III H.) Fig. 23 demonstrates that, with a ﬁxed set of
the parameters γ, θ, κ, µ, and ρ, Eqs. (57) and (58) very well
reproduce the distribution of log-returns x of the Dow-Jones
index for all times t. In the log-linear scale of Fig. 23, the tails
of ln Pt(x) vs. x are straight lines, which means that that tails
of Pt(x) are exponential in x. For short times, the distribution
is narrow, and the slopes of the tails are nearly vertical. As
time progresses, the distribution broadens and ﬂattens.

F. Asymptotic behavior for long time t

Eq. (24) implies that variance reverts to the equilibrium
value θ within the characteristic relaxation time 1/γ. In this

section, we consider the asymptotic limit where time t is much

Thus, Eq. (57) in the limit γt ≫ 2 can be represented in the

scaling form

Pt(x) = Nt e−p0xP∗(z), P∗(z) = K1(z)/z,

(65)

where the argument z = √A2 + B2 is

Eq. (65) demonstrates that, up to the factors Nt and e−p0x, the
dependence of Pt(x) on the two arguments x and t is given by
the function P∗(z) of the single scaling argument z in (66).
Thus, when plotted as a function of z, the data for different
x and t should collapse on the single universal curve P∗(z).
This is beautifully illustrated by Fig. 24, where the Dow-Jones
data for different time lags t follows the curve P∗(z) for seven
decades.
In the limit z ≫ 1, we can use the asymptotic expression72
K1(z) ≈ e−zpπ/2z in (65) and take the logarithm of P .
Keeping only the leading term proportional to z and omitting
the subleading term proportional to ln z, we ﬁnd

ln

for

Pt(x)
Nt ≈ −p0x − z

z ≫ 1.
Let us examine Eq. (68) for large and small |x|.
In the ﬁrst case |x| ≫ γθt/κ, Eq. (66) gives z ≈
ω0|x|/κp1 − ρ2, so Eq. (68) becomes

(68)

ω0

(69)

ln

Pt(x)
Nt ≈ −p0x −

κp1 − ρ2|x|.

Thus, the probability distribution Pt(x) has the exponential
tails (69) for large log-returns |x|. Notice that, in the consid-
ered limit γt ≫ 2, the slopes d ln P/dx of the exponential
tails (69) do not depend on time t. Because of p0, the slopes
(69) for positive and negative x are not equal, thus the distri-
bution Pt(x) is not symmetric with respect to up and down
price changes. According to (61), this asymmetry is enhanced
by a negative correlation ρ < 0 between stock price and vari-
ance.

In the second case |x| ≪ γθt/κ, by Taylor-expanding z in
(66) near its minimum and substituting the result into (68), we
get

ln

Pt(x)
N′t ≈ −p0x −

ω0(x + ργθt/κ)2

,

(70)

where N′t = Nt exp(−ω0γθt/κ2). Thus, for small log-
returns |x|, the probability distribution Pt(x) is Gaussian with
the width increasing linearly in time. The maximum of Pt(x)
in (70) is achieved at

xm(t) = −

γθt

2ω0(cid:18)1 + 2

ρ(ω0 − γ)

κ

(cid:19) .

(71)

Eq. (71) gives the most probable log-return xm(t) at time t,
and the coefﬁcient in front of t constitutes a correction to the
average growth rate µ, so that the actual growth rate is ¯µ =
µ + dxm/dt.

As Fig. 23 illustrates, ln Pt(x) is indeed linear in x for large
|x| and quadratic for small |x|, in agreement with (69) and
(70). As time progresses, the distribution, which has the scal-
ing form (65) and (66), broadens. Thus, the fraction Gt of the
total probability contained in the parabolic (Gaussian) portion
of the curve increases, as illustrated in Fig. 25.

In the remainder of the section, we explain the way the
Gaussian weight of the distribution has been calculated. As

explained in Sec. III H, the case relevant for comparison with
the data is ρ = 0.
In this case, by shifting the contour of
integration in (57) as follows px → px + i/2, we ﬁnd

Now the function Ft(px) is real and symmetric: Ft(px) =
Ft(−px). Thus, the integral in (72) is a symmetric function of
x. So it is clear that the only source of asymmetry of Pt(x) in
x is the exponential prefactor in (72), as discussed at the end
of Sec. III H. Eqs. (72), (73), and (74) are much simpler than
those for ρ 6= 0.

Let us expand the integral in (72) for small x:

Pt(x) ≈ e−x/2(cid:18)µ0 −

(76)
On the other hand, we know that Pt(x) is Gaussian for small
x. So we can write

Pt(x) ≈ µ0 e−x/2e−µ2x2/2µ0 ,

(77)

with the same coefﬁcients as in (75). If we ignore the exis-
tence of fat tails and extrapolate (77) to x ∈ (−∞,∞), the
total probability contained in such a Gaussian extrapolation
will be

Gt =

dx µ0 e−x/2−µ2x2/2µ0 =s 2πµ3

µ2

eµ0/8µ2 .

(78)

Obviously, Gt < 1, because the integral (78) does not take
into account the probability contained in the fat tails. Thus,
the difference 1 − Gt can be taken as a measure of how much
the actual distribution Pt(x) deviates from a Gaussian func-
tion.

We calculate the moments (76) numerically for the function
F given by (73), then determine the Gaussian weight Gt from
(78) and plot it in Fig. 25 as a function of time. For t → ∞,
Gt → 1, i.e. Pt(x) becomes Gaussian for very long time lags,
which is known in literature55. In the opposite limit t → 0,
Ft(px) becomes a very broad function of px, so we cannot
calculate the moments µ0 and µ2 numerically. The singular
limit t → 0 requires an analytical study.

Fig. 25 shows that, at sufﬁciently long times, the total prob-
ability contained in the non-Gaussian tails becomes negligi-
ble, which is known in literature55. The inset in Fig. 25 illus-
trates that the time dependence of the probability density at
maximum, Pt(xm), is close to t−1/2, which is characteristic
of a Gaussian evolution.

G. Asymptotic behavior for large log-return x

In the complex plane of px, function F (px) becomes sin-
gular at the points px where the argument of any logarithm
in (58) vanishes. These points are located on the imaginary
axis of px and are shown by dots in Fig. 26. The singu-
larity closest to the real axis is located on the positive (neg-
ative) imaginary axis at the point p+
1 (p−1 ). At these two
points, the argument of the last logarithm in (58) vanishes, and
we can approximate F (px) by the dominant, singular term:
F (px) ≈ −(2γθ/κ2) ln(px − p±1 ).
For large |x|, the integrand of (57) oscillates very fast as a
function of px. Thus, we can evaluate the integral using the
method of stationary phase70 by shifting the contour of inte-
gration so that is passes through a saddle point of the argument
ipxx + F (px) of the exponent in (57). The saddle point posi-
tion ps, shown in Fig. 26 by the symbol ×, is determined by
the equation

where q±t = ∓ip±1 (t) are real and positive. Eq. (80) shows
that, for all times t, the tails of the probability distribution
Pt(x) for large|x| are exponential. The slopes of the exponen-
tial tails, q± = ∓ d ln P/dx, are determined by the positions
p±1 of the singularities closest to the real axis.
These positions p±1 (t) and, thus, the slopes q±t depend
on time t. For times much shorter than the relaxation time
(γt ≪ 2), the singularities lie far away from the real axis.
As time increases, the singularities move along the imaginary
axis toward the real axis. Finally, for times much longer than
the relaxation time (γt ≫ 2), the singularities approach lim-
iting points: p±1 → ±iq±
, which are shown in Fig. 26 by

circled ×’s. Thus, as illustrated in Fig. 27, the slopes q±t
monotonously decrease in time and saturate at long times:

The dotted curve in Fig. 27 shows that Eq. (82) works very

To test the model against ﬁnancial data, we downloaded
daily closing values of the Dow-Jones industrial index for the
period of 20 years from 1 January 1982 to 31 December 2001
from the Web site of Yahoo73. The data set contains 5049
points, which form the time series {Sτ}, where the integer
time variable τ is the trading day number. We do not ﬁlter the
data for short days, such as those before holidays.

t

Given {Sτ}, we use the following procedure to extract the
probability density P (DJ)
(r) of log-return r for a given time
lag t. For the ﬁxed t, we calculate the set of log-returns
{rτ = ln Sτ +t/Sτ} for all possible times τ. Then we par-
tition the r-axis into equally spaced bins of the width ∆r and
count the number of log-returns rτ belonging to each bin. In
this process, we omit the bins with occupation numbers less
than ﬁve, because we consider such a small statistics unreli-
able. Only less than 1% of the entire data set is omitted in this
procedure. Dividing the occupation number of each bin by
∆r and by the total occupation number of all bins, we obtain
the probability density P (DJ)
(r) for a given time lag t. To
ﬁnd P (DJ)
(x), we replace r → x + µt. In Fig. 28 we plot
the value of the Dow-Jones index, and the ﬁt with an expo-
nential function corresponding to an inﬂation rate µ. In Fig.
29 we illustrate the histogram corresponding to the probabil-
ity density P (DJ)
(r) for a time lag t = 5 days. The ﬁrst and
last bin in Fig. 29 show all the events outside the two vertical
dashed lines. These events are very rare, contribute less than
1% to the entire number of data points, and therefore they are
discarded in the ﬁtting process.

previous sections, which describes ensemble distribution. In
the language of mathematical statistics, we compare our the-
oretically derived population distribution with the sample dis-
tribution extracted from the time series data. We determine
parameters of the model by minimizing the mean-square devi-
ationPx,t | ln P (DJ)
(x)− ln Pt(x)|2, where the sum is taken
over all available x and t = 1, 5, 20, 40, and 250 days.
These values of t are selected because they represent differ-
ent regimes: γt ≪ 1 for t = 1 and 5 days, γt ≈ 1 for t = 20
days, and γt ≫ 1 for t = 40 and 250 days. As Figs. 23 and
24 illustrate, our expression (57) and (58) for the probability
density Pt(x) agrees with the data very well, not only for the
selected ﬁve values of time t, but for the whole time interval
from 1 to 250 trading days. However, we cannot extend this
comparison to t longer than 250 days, which is approximately
1/20 of the entire range of the data set, because we cannot
reliably extract P (DJ)

(x) from the data when t is too long.

The values obtained for the four ﬁtting parameters (γ, θ, κ,
µ) are given in Table III. Within the scattering of the data, we
do not ﬁnd any discernible difference between the ﬁts with the
correlation coefﬁcient ρ being zero or slightly different from
zero. Thus, we conclude that the correlation ρ between the
noise terms for stock price and variance in Eq. (25) is practi-
cally zero, if it exists at all. Our conclusion is in contrast with
the value ρ = −0.58 found in74 by ﬁtting the leverage corre-
lation function introduced in75. Further study is necessary in
order to resolve this discrepancy. Nevertheless, all theoretical
curves shown in this chapter are calculated for ρ = 0, and they
ﬁt the data very well.

All four parameters (γ, θ, κ, µ) shown in Table III have the
dimensionality of 1/time. The ﬁrst line of the Table gives their
values in the units of 1/day, as originally determined in our ﬁt.
The second line shows the annualized values of the parameters

in the units of 1/year, where we utilize the average number of
252.5 trading days per calendar year to make the conversion.
The relaxation time of variance is equal to 1/γ = 22.2 trading
days = 4.4 weeks ≈ 1 month, where we took into account that
1 week = 5 trading days. Thus, we ﬁnd that variance has a
rather long relaxation time, of the order of one month, which
is in agreement with the conclusion of Ref.74.

Using the numbers given in Table III, we ﬁnd the value
of the parameter 2γθ/κ2 = 1.296. Since this parameter is
greater than one, the stochastic process (24) never reaches the
domain v < 0, as discussed in Sec. III B.

The effective growth rate of stock prices is determined by
the coordinate rm(t) where the probability density Pt(rm) is
maximal. Using the relation rm = xm + µt and Eq. (71), we
ﬁnd that the actual growth rate is ¯µ = µ− γθ/2ω0 = 13% per
year. This number coincides with the average growth rate of
the Dow-Jones index obtained by a simple ﬁt of the time series
{Sτ} with an exponential function of τ. The effective stock
growth rate ¯µ is comparable with the average stock volatility
after one year σ = √θ = 14.7%. Moreover, the parameter
(33), which characterizes the width of the stationary distribu-
tion of variance, is equal to χ = 0.54. This means that the
distribution of variance is broad, and variance can easily ﬂuc-
tuate to a value twice greater than the average value θ. Thus,
even though the average growth rate of stock index is posi-
dr Pt(r) = 17.7%

tive, there is a substantial probabilityR 0

to have negative growth for t = 1 year.

According to (81), the asymmetry between the slopes of
exponential tails for positive and negative x is given by the
parameter p0, which is equal to 1/2 when ρ = 0 (see also the
discussion of Eq. (72) at the end of Sec. III F). The origin
of this asymmetry can be traced back to the transformation
from (23) to (26) using Itˆo’s formula. It produces the term
0.5vt dt in the r.h.s. of (26), which then generates the second
term in the r.h.s. of (28). The latter term is the only source of
asymmetry in x of Pt(x) when ρ = 0. However, in practice,
the asymmetry of the slopes p0 = 1/2 is quite small (about
∗ ≈ ω0/κ = 18.4.
2.7%) compared with the average slope q±

I. Conclusions

We derived an analytical solution for the probability dis-
tribution Pt(x) of log-returns x as a function of time t for
the model of a geometrical Brownian motion with stochastic
variance. The ﬁnal result has the form of a one-dimensional
Fourier integral (57) and (58).
[In the case ρ = 0, the
equations have the simpler form (72), (73), and (74).] Nu-
merical evaluation of the integral (57) is simple compared

with computationally-intensive numerical solution of the orig-
inal Fokker-Planck PDE or Monte-Carlo simulation of the
stochastic processes.

IV. PATH-INTEGRAL SOLUTION OF THE
COX-INGERSOLL-ROSS/FELLER MODEL

26

Our result agrees very well with the Dow-Jones data, as
shown in Fig. 23. Comparing the theory and the data, we de-
termine the four (non-zero) ﬁtting parameters of the model,
particularly the variance relaxation time 1/γ = 22.2 days.
For time longer than 1/γ, our theory predicts scaling behavior
(65) and (66), which the Dow-Jones data indeed exhibits over
seven orders of magnitude, as shown in Fig. 24. The scal-
ing function P∗(z) = K1(z)/z is expressed in terms of the
ﬁrst-order modiﬁed Bessel function K1. Previous estimates
in literature of the relaxation time of volatility using various
indirect indicators range from 1.5 days57 (p. 80) to less than
one day and more than few tens of days51 (p. 70) for S&P 500
and 73 days for the half-life of the Dow-Jones index56. Since
we have a very good ﬁt of the entire probability distribution
function for times from 1 to 250 trading days, we believe that
our estimate, 22.2 days, is much more reliable. A close value
of 19.6 days was found in Ref.74.

As Fig. 23 shows, the probability distribution Pt(x) is ex-
ponential in x for large |x|, where it is characterized by time-
dependent slopes d ln P/dx. The theoretical analysis pre-
sented in Sec. III G shows that the slopes are determined by
the singularities of the function Ft(px) from (58) in the com-
plex plane of px that are closest to the real axis. The cal-
culated time dependence of the slopes d ln P/dx, shown in
Fig. 27, agrees with the data very well, which further supports
our statement that 1/γ = 22.2 days. Exponential tails in the
probability distribution of stock log-returns have been noticed
in literature before51 (p. 61),76, however time dependence of
the slopes has not been recognized and analyzed theoretically.
In Ref.55, the power-law behavior of the tails has been em-
phasized. However, the data for S&P 500 were analyzed in
Ref.55 only for short time lags t, typically shorter than one
day. On the other hand, our data analysis is performed for the
time lags longer than one day, so the results cannot be directly
compared.

Our analytical expression for the probability distribution
of returns can be utilized to calculate option pricing. No-
tice that it is not necessary to introduce the ad-hoc function
λ(S, v, t), the market-price of risk, as is typically done in
literature50,57,58,59,60, because now Pt(x) is known explicitly.
Using the true probability distribution of returns Pt(x) should
improve option pricing compared with the previous efforts in
literature.

Although we tested our model for the Dow-Jones index,
there is nothing speciﬁc in the model which indicates that it
applies only to stock market data. It would be interesting to
see how the model performs when applied to other time series,
for example, the foreign exchange data77, which also seem to
exhibit exponential tails.

In this section we provide details on the path-integral solu-
tion of the variance process (24). The stochastic differential
equation of the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross/Feller process, Eq. (24),
is

dxt = −γ(xt − θ)dt + κ√xtdWt.

(83)

Here θ is the long-time mean of x, γ is the rate of relaxation
to this mean, Wt is the standard Wiener process, and κ is a
parameter that controls the amplitude of the noise. Eq. (83) is
known in ﬁnancial literature as the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR)
process and it was used to model of interest rate dynamics.
Feller79 used equation (83) to model population extinction in
biological systems. Recently, the same equation (83) was used
to model the thermal reversal of magnetization in a magnetic
grain80.

One quantity of interest to calculate is the conditional (tran-
sition) probability P (x, t| xi, ti), which gives the probability
to ﬁnd the system at position x at time t, given that it was
at position xi at initial time ti. The transition probability
P (x, t| xi, ti) of the stochastic process described by (83) sat-
isﬁes the Fokker-Planck equation

in the coordinate “x” representation,

with the Hamiltonian

ˆH =

ˆp2 ˆx − iγ ˆp(ˆx − θ).

(86)

In the coordinate representation, the momentum operator ˆp is
given by the derivative operator ˆp = −id/dx. The canoni-
cal commutation relation holds true: [ˆx, ˆp] = i. Using this
analogy with quantum mechanics, the transition probability
P (x, t| xi, ti) can be found using the method of path inte-
grals. The transition probability is the matrix element of the
evolution operator ˆU (t, ti) = exp(− ˆH(t − ti)) between the
initial state | xii, and ﬁnal state hxf |,

P (xf , tf | xi, ti) = hxf | e− ˆH(tf−ti) | xii.

(87)

The standard construction of the path integral is obtained
by splitting the time interval [ti, tf ] into M time steps of equal
size ǫ = (tf − ti)/M . One uses the multiplication property of
the transition probability to write

hxf|e− ˆH(tf−ti)|xii =Z M−1Yj=1

as

×hpj|e− ˆH(tj−tj−1)|xj−1i.

(89)

The matrix element inside the integral in Eq.(89) can be now
evaluated to

hpj|e− ˆH(tj−tj−1)|xj−1i ≈ e−ǫH(pj ,xj−1)hpj|xj−1i.

(95)
The phase-space path integral from Eq.(94) has to be calcu-
lated over all continuous paths p(t) and x(t) satisfying the
boundary conditions x(ti) = xi and x(tf ) = xf .

For most path-integrals in physics,

the path integral is
quadratic in momenta and because of that it is customary to
integrate ﬁrst the momenta p(t) to obtain the Lagrangean of
the problem, and be left with the path integral over the coor-
dinate x(t). This route can be taken here too, but the resulting
Lagrangean will have a position dependent mass, which un-
necessary complicates the remaining integration over the co-
ordinate. It is important to notice that the problem is linear
in the coordinate x(t) and quadratic in p(t), so the original
Schr¨odinger formulation will be simpler in the momentum
representation. In the path-integral formulation, it turns out
that the integration over x(t) is trivial and gives a delta func-
tional.

27

Both the continuous expression (94) and the discrete one
(92) have their own computational advantages. In the follow-
ing, I will use the discrete form (92), because for this problem,
it allows for a quick and transparent solution. The exponent
in (92) can be rearranged in the form

function 2πδ(pM−1 − pM + ǫγpM + iǫκ2p2
gration over pM−1 resolves the delta function for the value
of pM−1 equal to pM−1 ≡ (1 − ǫ ˆT )pM , where the operator
ˆT = γ(·) + k2(·)2/2. The integral over dxM−2 is done next,
with the result 2πδ(pM−2−(1− ˆT )2pM ), followed by the inte-
gral over dpM−2. The procedure is repeated until the last pair
