Abstract

This study investigates that a characteristic time scale on an ex-
change rate market (USD/JPY) is examined for the period of 1998
to 2000. Calculating power spectrum densities for the number of tick
quotes per minute and averaging them over the year yield that the
mean power spectrum density has a peak at high frequencies. Conse-
quently it means that there exist the characteristic scales which dealers
act in the market. A simple agent model to explain this phenomenon
is proposed. This phenomena may be a result of stochastic resonance
with exogenous periodic information and physiological ﬂuctuations of
the agents. This may be attributed to the traders’ behavior on the
market. The potential application is both quantitative characteriza-
tion and classiﬁcation of foreign currency markets.

Key words. power spectrum density, agent-based model,

Introduction

Empirical analysis of high-frequency ﬁnancial data have been attracting sig-
niﬁcant interest among physicists as well as economists during a decade

1

(Mantegna and Stanley 2000, and Dacorogna 2001). Many features of ﬁ-
nancial markets have been clariﬁed by many successive studies.

Actually it is well-known that the markets have a characteristic time
scale in long period (daily, weekly, and monthly). However recent studies
(Takayasu 2003, Ohnishi 2004 and Mizuno 2004) on time-series analyses in
ﬁnancial markets show that the market has a characteristic time scale in short
period and propose the reason why traders are mainly using strategies with
weighted feedbacks of past prices. Furthermore using the self-modulation
process Takayasu et al. have found that the characteristic time scale is about
2 minutes in the JPY/USD market (Takayasu 2003) (abbreviated as MT).

On the other hand Baninec and Krawiech and Ho lst proposed a possibility
that stochastic resonance occurs in markets (Babinec 2002 and Krawiech
2003) through an Ising-like agent model. They suggest that a periodicity
in the market results from exogenous periodical information (abbreviated as
BKH).

In order to clarify the mechanism of this characteristic time I think that
we should examine it on a diﬀerent standpoint from MT and BKH. Both stud-
ies focus on prices or price returns. However, in this article, we focus on the
number of tick quotes in foreign currency rates (USD/JPY) and investigate
the statistical properties of them by utilizing the power spectrum technique.
As the results of examining the number of tick quotes in USD/JPY market
it is found that the power spectrum density (PSD) has some peaks at about
2 minutes (the peak frequency depends on the currency markets).

In order to explain this phenomena a simple agent model based on double-
threshold noisy device (Sato 2004) is proposed. From a result of numerical
simulations of the model it is found that the high periodicity of the num-
ber of tick quotes may happen. This result leads to a hypothesis that this
periodicity is caused by common exogenous periodical information.

The purposes of this study are as follows: (1) to examine the number
of high-frequency quotes lead us to deeply understand microscopic market
activities.
(2) this may provide useful information for market players to
consider their trading strategy.

2 Data Analysis

The number of ask quotes per minute in USD/JPY is counted for a period of
1998 to 2000. Utilizing the data we calculated three PSDs for 2,048 points in

2

weekday and average them over the year. The averaged power spectrums on
the semi-log scale are shown in Fig. 1. They all have a peak at 0.4 (1/min),
namely 2.5 minutes. We consider that these peaks exhibit characteristic time
scales of dealers’ activities, i.e., the dealers act having the periodicity of 2.5
minutes.

3 Dealer model

We introduce a simple agent model based on double-threshold noisy devices
in order to understand the characteristic time scales found in the averaged
power spectrum density. This model contains N dealers and the ith dealer
has double-threshold (θ(1)
i ) to decide buy(1), sell(-1) and wait(0), and
noise source ξi(t) to model an uncertainty in their mind. We assume that
the ith dealer must choose a decision (output) into the three ones yi(t) =
{1, 0,−1} based on information (input) xi(t) with an uncertainty ξ(t) in
his/her mind:

i > θ(2)

yi(t) =




(xi(t) + ξi(t) > θ(1)

(θ(2)
i ≤ xi(t) + ξi(t) ≤ θ(1)
i )

−1 (xi(t) + ξi(t) < θ(2)

.

Here we assume that ξi(t) is identically independent Gaussian distribution,

2σ2
where σi are standard deviations of the ith dealer.

(2)

It is assumed that the input of each dealer is exogenous periodic informa-
tion s(t) = A sin(2πf t), where A represents an amplitude, and f a frequency.
For s(t) > 0 the dealers feel it good news and tend to decide a buy, while for
s(t) < 0 they do it bad news and to decide a sell.

Furthermore the number of tick quotes per unit time X(t) is deﬁned as

X(t) =

i=1 |yi(t)|.

(3)

For simplicity assume θ(1)

i = −θ. Obviously the activity
X(t) is always zero if σ = 0 and A < θ, so that, there is no uncertainty
of the dealers in their mind and the exogenous information is weaker than

i = θ and θ(2)

3

the threshold for the dealers to decide their action. However if there is
uncertainty σ > 0 then the activity X(t) can exhibit periodicity despite
of A < θ due to stochastic resonance (see Gammaitoni H¨anggi Jung and
Marchesoni (1998)).

As shown in Fig. 2 it is found that the PSD has some peaks from nu-
merical simulations of the dealer model for σ > 0 and A < θ. This peak is
caused by stochastic resonance.

4 Discussion and Conclusion

We empirically investigate the number of the tick quotes per unit time in
foreign currency market (USD/JPY). It is found that the power spectrum
densities of them for a period 1998 to 2000 all have a peak at 0.4 [1/min].
From the results it is conclude that a periodical action of dealers exists.

In order to explain this phenomena a simple dealer model based on the
double-threshold noisy devices is proposed. Under a hypothesis that the
mechanism of this periodicity is stochastic resonance the market activity
in the model shows periodicity due to uncertainty of dealers’ decision even
though the exogenous periodical information is weaker than the threshold for
dealers to decide their action. In fact this model is a feedforward one, how-
ever, real markets contains complicated (positive and negative) feedbacks.
The future work is to consider the feedbacks to improve the dealer model.

Moreover the source of this periodicity is open problem. One possibility
is an endogenous feedback mechanism of dealers as shown in MT. The other
is an exogenous periodical information as shown in this paper. More detailed
data analyses let us clarify the mechanism of this phenomena. To consider
this problem is expected to contribute to a deep understanding of ﬂuctuations
and structure in the market.
