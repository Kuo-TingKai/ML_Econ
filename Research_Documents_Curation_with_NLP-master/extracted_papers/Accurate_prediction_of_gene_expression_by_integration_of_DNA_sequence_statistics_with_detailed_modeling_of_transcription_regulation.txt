Abstract 
Gene  regulation  involves  a  hierarchy  of  events  that  extend  from  specific  protein-
DNA  interactions  to  the  combinatorial  assembly  of  nucleoprotein  complexes.  The 
effects of DNA sequence on these processes have typically been studied based either 
on  its  quantitative  connection  with  single-domain  binding  free  energies  or  on 
empirical rules that combine different DNA motifs to predict gene expression trends 
on a genomic scale. The middle-point approach that quantitatively bridges these two 
extremes,  however,  remains  largely  unexplored.  Here,  we  provide  an  integrated 
approach  to  accurately  predict  gene  expression  from  statistical  sequence 
information  in  combination  with  detailed  biophysical  modeling  of  transcription 
regulation by multidomain binding on multiple DNA sites. For the regulation of the 
prototypical 
this  approach  predicts  within  0.3-fold  accuracy 
transcriptional activity over a 10,000-fold range from DNA sequence statistics for 
different intracellular conditions.

Introduction 
In a now classic paper proposing the lac operon model, Jacob and Monod put forward the 
very basic principles of gene regulation (1). They reasoned that there are molecules that 
bind to specific sites in nucleic acids to control whether or not genes are expressed. Since 
then, a major challenge in biology has been to understand how site-specific regulatory 
factors  function  and  the  effects  that  they  have  in  gene  regulation.  Thus,  over  the  last 
decades,  there  have  been  a  large  effort  to  produce  reliable  and  efficient  computer 
algorithms for the analysis and prediction of DNA binding sites (2).  
These  algorithms  have  reached  an  extraordinary  ability  at  predicting  with  high 
 
accuracy  how  proteins  bind  single  sites  (3,  4).  At  the  same  time,  use  of  these  highly 
accurate models to predict where additional binding sites might occur typically finds a 
wealth of sites that are not physiologically relevant (2). A rule of thumb to predict actual 
binding  is  that  relevant  sites  often  appear  close  to  each  other  to  act  cooperatively  (5). 
Clever  refinement  of  this  idea  has  led  to  heuristic  approaches  that  have  proved  very 
successful at predicting the main gene expression trends on a genomic scale (6-12). The 
middle ground between detailed single site and broad genomic predictions, however, still 
remains largely unexplored. 
 
Here,  we  develop  a  quantitative  framework  that  accurately  integrates  sequence 
statistics with a biophysical model for multidomain binding on non-adjacent DNA sites 
using as a prototype system the lac operon. This choice is motivated by two key features 
of the lac operon. 
First, the very simple, yet extremely powerful, original idea of the lac repressor 
 
preventing transcription upon binding to the  operator DNA in the promoter region has 
kept  evolving  over  the  years  to  uncover  a  highly  sophisticated  mechanism  that  goes 
beyond simple binding events (13). It incorporates now an activator and two additional 
binding sites for the repressor outside the promoter region. These two additional sites are 
orders  of  magnitude  weaker  than  the  main  one  and  by  themselves  do  not  affect 
transcription substantially. In combination with the main one, however, they can increase 
repression of transcription by almost a factor 100 (14, 15).

Second, there is extremely detailed information about the lac operon that offers 
 
the possibility of considering the actual mode of binding. This point is important because 
the  precise  sequence  has  been  shaped  by  evolution  through  the  actual  biophysical 
mechanism. The available information includes detailed quantitative models of how the 
lac  repressor  binds  to  two  sites  simultaneously  (16,  17)  and  to  the  three  sites  for  the 
repressor  together  with  the  effects  of  the  Catabolite  Activator  Protein  (CAP)  (18,  19). 
The  values  of  the  molecular  and  cellular  parameters  needed  by  the  models  are  also 
available, including the in vivo free energy of binding, the energetic costs of bending and 
twisting DNA upon two-site binding, and the effective transcription rate as a function of 
the binding state of the repressor (13, 20).  
Therefore,  the  lac  operon  provides  an  efficient  platform  to  accurately  test 
 
multisite models. In this classical example, without considering the two additional sites, 
no matter how good the single site model is, it would be off by a factor of almost 100.  
 
The focus here is to provide an avenue to extend traditional biophysical single-
domain-binding models (21-23) to incorporate the details of multidomain binding, which 
are  inherently  different  from  those  of  single-domain  binding  of  multiple  transcription 
factors. The traditional approach considers the interaction of a transcription factor,  TF , 
with a DNA site,   S1, as a binding reaction of the type  TF + S1 ⇔ TF ⋅ S1. The strength 
of the binding is typically assessed through position weight matrix (PWM) scores, which 
are  directly  related  to  the  binding  energy  of  the  DNA–protein  interaction  (3,  24).  The 
extension to multidomain transcription factors in the presence of additional binding sites, 
type 
denoted 
  TF ⋅ S1+ S2 ⇔ S2 ⋅TF ⋅ S1  and  S2 ⋅TF ⋅ S1+ S3 ⇔ S3⋅TF ⋅ S1+ S2 .  These  more 
complex reactions account for binding of one domain of the TF while its other domain is 
still  bound  to  DNA  and  usually  involve  looping  the  DNA  between  each  pair  of 
simultaneously bound sites. 
The multisite approach is explicitly implemented by considering first the three lac 
 
operators as DNA signals. They are used to construct a probabilistic model that provides 
PWM  scores  for  binding  of  a  lac  repressor  domain  to  these  and  similar  mutated 
sequences. The scores are subsequently linked parametrically to binding free energies and 
incorporated  directly  into  a  detailed  biophysical  model  of  transcription  regulation  that

decomposition  of  the  free  energy  of  the  protein-DNA  complex  into  different  modular 
contributions. The link between scores and free energies is calibrated by fitting the model 
to a subset of experimental transcription data. The calibrated model is then tested with 
different sets of data (Figure 1).  

Methods 

From sequence to score  
The  PWM  method  is  used  to  describe  repressor-operator  binding  (3,  24).    It  assigns  a 
score S to the sequence

(1)  

xip   is  the  estimated  probability  of  having  the  nucleotide  x  at  position  i  of  the

binding site and  qx   is the background frequency of that nucleotide. Taking into account 
small sample size,  pxi  is estimated from the observed positional frequency as 

 

pxi =

nxi + 1

, 

 (2) 

where   nxi   is  the  number  of  sites  having  a  nucleotide x  at  position  i  and  N  is  the  total 
number  of  sites  in  the  training  set.  In  our  case,  we  have  only  three  sequences  in  the 
training set corresponding to the three operators.  
 

From score to free energy 
We  assume  a  linear  relationship  to  transform  the  score  S  of  each  sequence  into  the 
interaction free energies, e , between the lac repressor domain and the DNA site: 
 
(3) 
where  a   and   b  are  constants  to  be  inferred  from  experiments.  With  this  linear 
assumption,  a  selects the energy units and  b the reference zero of energy. 
 

e = aS + b ,

Multidomain binding 
The  lac  repressor  is  a  tetramer  consisting  of  two  dimeric  DNA  binding  domains. 
Multidomain  binding  is  taken  into  account  by  decomposing  the  free  energy  of  the 
protein-DNA  complex  into  different  modular  contributions,  including  positional, 
interaction, and conformational free energies (19, 25).  
The positional free energy,  p , accounts for the cost of bringing the lac repressor 
 
to its DNA binding site. Its dependence on the repressor concentration,  n , is given by 
  p = p° − RT ln n, where  p°  is the positional free energy at 1M. Interaction free energies, 
e , arise from the physical contact between a binding domain and DNA site.  Thus, when 
only a single domain is involved, the free energy of binding is given by  ΔG = e + p .  For 
two  domains,  denoted  by  subscripts  1  and  2,  the  free  energy  of  binding  is  given  by 
  ΔG = e1 + e2 + c + p . Conformational free energies,  c , account for changes in DNA and 
repressor  conformation,  which  are  needed  to  accommodate  multiple  simultaneous 
interactions (Figure 2).  
 
for specific binding of the lac repressor, can be expressed in mathematical terms as 

All these contributions to the free energy, taking into account the three operators 

ΔG(s) = ( p + e1)s1 + ( p + e2)s2 + ( p + e3)s3

  

  

+(cL12 − ps1s2)sL12 + (cL13 − ps1s3)sL13 + (cL23 − ps2s3)sL23
+∞(sL12sL13 + sL12sL23 + sL13sL23) ,

 

(4) 

where    s1 ,    s2 ,  and    s3  are  state  variables  that  can  take  the  values  0  and  1  to  indicate 
whether ( = 1) or not  ( = 0 ) the repressor is bound to O1, O2, and O3, respectively; and 
  sL12 ,   sL13 , and   sL23   are variables that indicate whether ( = 1) or not  ( = 0 )   DNA forms 
the  loops    O1-O2,    O1-O3,  and  O2-O3,  respectively.    The  subscripts  of  the  different 
contributions  to  the  free  energy  have  the  same  meaning  as  those  of  the  corresponding 
binary  variables.  The  infinity  in  the  last  term  of  the  free  energy  implements  that  two 
loops that share one operator cannot be present simultaneously by assigning an infinite 
free energy to those states (18).  
The set of 6 state variables, denoted by  s = (s1,s2,s3,sL12,sL13,sL23) , describes the 
 
specific binding configuration of the repressor-DNA complex. For instance, a repressor 

 

5

bound to O2 is specified by  s = (0,1,0,0,0,0) ; a repressor bound to O1 and O3 looping the 
intervening DNA, by  s = (1,0,1,0,1,0) ; and three repressors bound, one to each operator, 
by  s = (1,1,1,0,0,0) . The specific value of the free energy is obtained by substituting the 
values of the state variables in the expression of the free energy. This description in terms 
of state variables can be visualized as a factor graph (Figure 3).  
 
is obtained from statistical thermodynamics as 

The probability of any of these states depends exponentially on its free energy and

Transcriptional control 
Gene expression in the lac operon is completely abolished when the repressor is bound to 
O1; otherwise, transcription takes place either at an activated maximum rate,  Γmax , when 
O3 is free or at a basal reduced rate,  χΓmax , when O3 is occupied. This reduction by a 
factor  χ  arises  because  binding  of  the  repressor  to  O3  prevents  CAP  from  activating 
transcription (13, 18).    
 

The transcription rate   Γ(s)  can be expressed in terms of state variables as 

 

  Γ(s) = Γmax(1− s1)(χs3 + (1− s3)) .

is obtained by computing the thermodynamic average over all the representative states; 
namely, by performing the sum above over all possible combination of values of s.

Model calibration 
The overall model has only two free parameters: the constants  a  and  b that relate scores 
to  free  energies  of  binding.  Their  values  are  inferred  by  minimizing  the  square 
logarithmic error between measured and model normalized transcription ( Γ / Γmax ). The 
values  of  the  other  four  parameters,  three  conformational  free  energies  and  CAP 
activation,  are  taken  from  the  experimental  data.  Explicitly,  the  value  χ=0.03  was 
reported  in  Ref.  (26);  the  value  cL12=23.35  kcal/mol  was  obtained  in  Ref.  (20)  from 
experimental data in Ref. (26); the values cL13=22.05 kcal/mol and cL23 =23.50 kcal/mol 
were  obtained  from  the  value  of  cL12  by  taking  into  account  the  dependence  of  the 
conformational  free  energy  on  the  distance  between  operators  (20,  27,  28)  and  the 
stabilization of the O1-O3 loop by CAP (29, 30).   
 

Results and Discussion 
We  applied  the  multisite  approach  to  classic  experiments  on  the  lac  operon  that 
considered  gene  expression  for  different  repressor  concentrations  in  E.  coli  strains 
covering all eight possible combinations of operator deletions (14). The sequences of the 
three  wild-type  (WT)  operators  O1,  O2,  and  O3  were  used  to  compute  the  PWM  from 
which we obtained the scores for these three operators and their respective "deletions" 
O1M, O2M, and O3M (See Table 1). The scores correctly ranked the three WT operators 
according to their measured strength and consistently ranked all the deletions below all 
the WT operators.

relation   e = aS + b   in  Equation 4.    In  this  way,  the  binding  is  described  by  the  PWM 

as  the  free  energy  of  the  system.  This  expression  is  obtained  after  substitution  of  the 

 

7

scores   S1 ,   S2, and   S3 for each site together with the conformational contributions to the 

free energy from DNA looping (28). 
The model, with just  a  and  b as free parameters, is able to fit the experimental 
 
data (14) within 0.29-fold accuracy over a 10,000-fold range of transcriptional activity 
(Figure  4A).  In  total,  there  are  22  experimental  points,  accounting  for  8  operator 
configurations, three different repressor concentrations, and different functional forms of 
the transcription curves.  The value  FA  that quantifies the ability of the model to capture 
the  experimental  data  within  FA -fold  accuracy  is  explicitly  defined  for  a  set  of  N

computed values differ from each other by a factor 1 FA+
The interaction free energies obtained from the model for the best-fit  a  and  b 
 
parameters and the corresponding experimental in vivo values (18) are shown in Table 1. 
The results of the model exhibit a good agreement with the available experimental data. 
In  terms  of  dissociation  constants,  the  differences  between  the  predicted  and  observed 
values  are  within  the  2-fold  range  (Table  1).  An  advantage  of  the  approach  we  have 
followed is that the in vivo free energies, and the corresponding dissociation constants, 
take into account implicitly the effects of non-specific binding. The reason is that their 
values are measured with respect to the  reference state with no repressor bound to the 
operators,  which  includes  the  repressors  in  solution  in  the  cytosol  as  well  as  the 
repressors  bound  non-specifically  to  DNA  (for  a  detailed  quantitative  discussion  see 
Appendix II of Ref. (16)).   
 
To test the predictive potential of the multisite model, we used experimental data 
sets for two operator configurations to infer the values of the parameters  a  and  b, and 
then  used  the  calibrated  model  to  predict  the  transcriptional  activity  for  the  other  six 
configurations (Figure 4B). The model accuracy at predicting new data decreases only 
slightly  with  respect  to  the  all-fit  accuracy.  In  principle,  only  two  experimental  data 
points would be needed to calibrate model because there are only two free parameters. 
Indeed, just two experimental points can be used to calibrate the model with just a slight 
additional  decease  in  global  accuracy  (Figure  4C).  Therefore,  without  using  any  free 

 

8

energy  of  binding,  the  multisite  model  is  able  to  accurately  predict  gene  expression 
curves over a 10,000-fold range for eight different E. coli strains covering all possible 
combinations of operator "deletions" from just two experimental calibration data points 
and the sequences of the six DNA sites involved.  
 
There  is  an  important  prediction  that  goes  beyond  the  experimentally  observed 
free energies of binding. The deletion O1M of the main operator O1 involved the mutation 
of just three DNA base pairs. As a consequence, the model predicts for O1M an increase 
in  free  energy  of  5.4  kcal/mol  with  respect  to  O1,  or  equivalently  about  an  8,000-fold 
increase of the dissociation constant, which is substantial but still remains relatively close 
to the free energy of binding to O3, the weakest WT operator (Table 1). We found that 
such  a  decrease  has  transcriptional  consequences  that  make  it  distinguishable  from  a 
complete  deletion  (Figure  5).    Thus,  the  multisite  approach  is  able  not  only  to  both 
accurately  predict  gene  expression  and  recover  known  free  energies  but  also  to  obtain 
precise  affinity  estimates  for  very  weak  sites  that  were  assumed  not  to  bind  the  lac 
repressor.  
 
Typically, the effects of a given sequence depend on the context. This dependence 
has  been  noted  explicitly  as  one  of  the  main  limiting  factors  for  identifying 
physiologically  relevant  sites  and  for  linking  statistical  sequence  information,  such  as 
PWM  scores,  to  transcriptional  activity  (31).  This  fundamental  problem  in  gene 
regulation  is  believed  to  result  from  the  interplay  among  multiple  DNA  sites  in 
orchestrating the binding patterns of transcription factors that control gene expression (2). 
The  approach  presented  here  overcomes  this  limitation  by  using  detailed  biophysical 
modeling  of  multidomain  binding  to  directly  connect  statistical  sequence  information 
with transcriptional activity. We have shown that, for the prototypical lac operon, which 
relies  on  a  cluster  of  three  non-adjacent  sites  over  a  0.5  kb  DNA  region  to  control 
transcription, this multisite approach accurately recapitulates the observed transcriptional 
activity over a 10,000-fold range for all the possible combinations of operator deletions.

energy  with 
  b = -9.064 kcal/mol.  The  experimental  values  of  these  free  energies,   e ,  are  from  Ref. 
(18) . Dissociation constants are computed as  K D

Figure  1:  Integration  of  sequence  statistics  into  predictive  biophysical  multidomain 
models. The approach is implemented by considering first the three operators as DNA 
signals. They are used to construct a probabilistic model that provides binding scores for 
these and similar mutated sequences. The scores are subsequently linked parametrically 
to  binding  free  energies  and  incorporated  directly  into  a  detailed  biophysical  model  of 
transcription regulation. The link between scores and free energies is calibrated by fitting 
the  model  to  a  subset  of  experimental  data.  The  calibrated  model  is  then  tested  with 
different sets of data. 
 
Figure 2: Operator locations on DNA and binding of the lac repressor. (A) The main, O1, 
and the two auxiliary, O2 and O3, operators are shown as black rectangles on the black 
line representing DNA. Binding of the lac repressor to O1 prevents transcription of the 
three lacZYA genes. (B) A repressor is shown bound to the operator O2. The free energy 
of  binding  is    ΔG = e2 + p .  (C)  A  repressor  is  shown  looping  DNA  by  binding 
simultaneously  to  O1  and  O3.  The  free  energy  of  this  binding  configuration  is 
  ΔG = e1 + e3 + cL13 + p .  
 
Figure  3:  Factor  graph  for  the  free  energy  components  of  the  multisite  lac  represor-
operator  binding.    The  free  energy  of  the  system,  ΔG(s) ,  as  a  function  of  the  state 
variables,  s = (s1,s2,s3,sL12,sL13,sL23) , has a graphical representation in the form of factor 
graph.  The  round  nodes  represent  state  variables  and  the  rectangular  nodes  represent 
contributions to the free energy. The quantity in the rectangular node is present in the free 
energy when all its connecting state variables are equal to 1.  The experimental values for 
wild-type  parameters  are  e1=-27.8  kcal/mol,  e2=-26.3  kcal/mol,  e3=-24.1  kcal/mol, 
cL12=23.35 kcal/mol, cL13=22.05 kcal/mol, and cL23 =23.50 kcal/mol. The dependence on 
the lac repressor concentration, n, is given by the positional free energy, p=p°-RT ln n, 
with  p°=15 kcal/mol.

Figure 4: Model calibration and prediction of the transcriptional activity as a function of 
the  repressor  concentration.  The  normalized  transcription    ( Γ / Γmax )  was  obtained  for 
WT  and  seven  mutants  accounting  for  all  the  combinations  of  deletions  of  the  three 
operators.  For  each  of  the  eight  cases,  the results  of  the  model (continuous  lines)  as  a 
function  of  the  repressor  concentration  are  compared  with  the  experimental  data  from 
Ref. (14) (square symbols). The particular set of WT or "deleted" operators is indicated 
for each curve; for instance, O1-O2-O3 corresponds to WT lac operon and O1M-O2M-O3M, 
to  the  mutant  with  all  three  operators  "deleted".    The  values  of  the  experimental 
parameters used are cL12=23.35 kcal/mol, cL13=22.05 kcal/mol, cL23 =23.50 kcal/mol, and 
χ=0.03. The PWM scores,  S , for each site are as shown in Table 1. (A) The values of the 
parameters  a = 1.387 kcal/mol  and  b = -9.064 kcal/mol  that  connect  interaction  free 
energies  with  scores,   e = aS + b ,  were  obtained  by  fitting  the  model  to  all  the 
experimental transcription data. (B) The values of the parameters  a = 1.348 kcal/mol and 
  b = −9.531 kcal/mol  were obtained by fitting the model to the experimental data for the 
operator  configurations  O1-O2-O3  and  O1M-O2-O3.  The  model  accurately  predicts  the 
normalized  transcription  for  the  other  six  operator  configurations.  (C)  Only  two 
experimental points (indicated by big gray circles) are used to obtain the values of the 
parameters  a = 1.462 kcal/mol  and  b = −8.208 kcal/mol .  The  model  is  still  able  to 
accurately predict the normalized transcription for the remaining 20 experimental points.  
 
Figure 5: Deletions versus weak binding. The normalized transcription ( Γ / Γmax ) for the 
four configurations with O1M is shown for the model as in Figure 4A (continuous line), 
for the model assuming that the free energy of binding to O1M is infinite as in a complete 
deletion  (discontinuous  line),  and  for  the  experimental  data  from  Ref.  (14)  (square 
symbols).
